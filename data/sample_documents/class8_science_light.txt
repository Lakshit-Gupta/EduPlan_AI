# Class 8 Science - Chapter: Light

## Learning Objectives
- Understand reflection and refraction of light
- Learn about lenses and their properties
- Explore the human eye and its functioning
- Understand the concept of dispersion of light

## Key Concepts
1. Light travels in a straight line
2. Reflection of light follows the law: angle of incidence equals angle of reflection
3. Refraction is the bending of light when it travels from one medium to another
4. Lenses can be convex or concave
5. The human eye works similar to a camera
6. White light consists of 7 colors (VIBGYOR)

## Experiments
1. Reflection using mirrors
2. Refraction using glass prism
3. Image formation by lenses
4. Dispersion of white light

## Assessment
1. Quiz on properties of light
2. Practical test on image formation
3. Diagram-based questions on the human eye
4. Group project on applications of light in daily life
