On the other hand, controlled motion can be a service to human beings such as in the generation of hydro-electric power. Do you feel the necessity to study the erratic motion of some objects and learn to control them?"

Consider the motion of an object moving along a straight path. The object starts its journey from O which is treated as its reference point (Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position of the object at different instants. At first, the object moves through C and B and reaches A. Then it moves back along the same path and reaches C through B. are used to describe the overall motion of an object and to locate its final position with reference to its initial position at a given time."

        "• Automobiles are fitted with a device that shows the distance travelled. Such a device is known as an odometer. A car is driven from Bhubaneshwar to New Delhi. The difference between the final reading and the initial reading of the odometer is 1850 km. • Find the magnitude of the displacement between Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi by using the Road Map of India. The total path length covered by the object is OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km. This is the distance covered by the object. To describe distance we need to specify only the numerical value and not the direction of motion. There are certain quantities which are described by specifying only their numerical values. The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude. From this example, can you find out the distance of the final position C of the object from the initial position O? This difference will give you the numerical value of the displacement of the object from O to C through A. The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object? Consider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For motion of the object from O to A,  the distance covered is 60 km  and the magnitude of displacement is also 60 km. During its motion from O to A and back to B, the distance covered Fig. 7.1: Positions of an object on a straight line path",
        "= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude of displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path length (85 km). Further, we will notice that the magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding distance covered is not zero. If we consider the object to travel back to O, the final position concides with the initial position, and therefore, the displacement is zero. However, the distance covered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km + 60 km = 120 km. Thus, two different physical quantities—the distance and the displacement, MOTION 73 Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 74"

Let it travel 5 m in the first second, 5 m more in the next second, 5 m in the third second and 5 m in the fourth second. In this case, the object covers 5 m in each second. As the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion. The time interval in this motion should be small. In our day-to-day life, we come across motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time, for example, when a car is moving on a crowded street or a person is jogging in a park. These are some instances of non-uniform motion."

        "Reprint 2025-26 MOTION 75 Look at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If the bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a) what does it mean? What do you understand from the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)? Different objects may take different amounts of time to cover a given distance. Some of them move fast and some move slowly. The rate at which objects move can be different. Also, different objects can move at the same rate. One of the ways of measuring the rate of motion of an object is to find out the distance travelled by the object in unit time. This quantity is referred to as speed. The SI unit of speed is metre per second. This is represented by the symbol m s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include centimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre per hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an object, we require only its magnitude. The speed of an object need not be constant. In most cases, objects will be in non-uniform motion. Therefore, we describe the rate of motion of such objects in terms of their average speed. The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. That is, average speed = Total distance travelled Total time taken If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is, v = s t (7.1) Let us understand this by an example. A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its average speed is 50 km h–1. The car might not have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time. Sometimes it might have travelled faster and sometimes slower than this. Example 7.1 An object travels 16 m in 4 s and then another 16 m in 2 s. What is the average speed of the object? Solution: Total distance travelled by the object = 16 m + 16 m = 32 m Total time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 s Average speed = Total distance travelled Total time taken = 32 m 6 s = 5.33 m s–1 Therefore, the average speed of the object is 5.33 m s–1. 7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION",
        "The rate of motion of an object can be more comprehensive if we specify its direction of motion along with its speed. The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called velocity. Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction. The velocity of an object can be uniform or variable. It can be changed by changing the object’s speed, direction of motion or both. When an object is moving along a straight line at a variable speed, we can express the magnitude of its rate of motion in terms of average velocity. It is calculated in the same way as we calculate average speed. In case the velocity of the object is changing at a uniform rate, then average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity for a given period of time. That is, average velocity = initial velocity + final velocity 2 Mathematically, v av  = u + v 2 (7.2) where vav is the average velocity, u is the initial velocity and v is the final velocity of the object. Speed and velocity have the same units, that is, m s–1 or m/s."

        "Reprint 2025-26 MOTION 77 77 77 77 77 To answer such a question, we have to introduce another physical quantity called acceleration, which is a measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time. That is, acceleration = change in velocity time taken If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value v in time t, the acceleration a is, v – u a = t (7.3) This kind of motion is known as accelerated motion. The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity. The SI unit of acceleration is m s–2 . If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform. The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. On the other hand, an object can travel with non-uniform acceleration if its velocity changes at a non-uniform rate. For example, if a car travelling along a straight road increases its speed by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the car is said to be moving with non-uniform acceleration."

        "Graphs provide a convenient method to present basic information about a variety of events. For example, in the telecast of a one-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs show the run rate of a team in each over. As you have studied in mathematics, a straight line graph helps in solving a linear equation having two variables. To describe the motion of an object, we can use line graphs. In this case, line graphs show dependence of one physical quantity, such as distance or velocity, on another quantity, such as time. 7.4.1 DISTANCE–TIME GRAPHS The change in the position of an object with time can be represented on the distance-time graph adopting a convenient scale of choice. In this graph, time is taken along the x–axis and distance is taken along the y-axis. Distance-time graphs can be employed under various conditions where objects move with uniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain at rest etc. Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving with uniform speed We know that when an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, it moves with uniform speed. This shows that the",
        "distance travelled by the object is directly proportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform speed, a graph of distance travelled against time is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The portion OB of the graph shows that the distance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note that, you can also use the term uniform velocity in place of uniform speed if you take the magnitude of displacement equal to the distance travelled by the object along the y-axis. We can use the distance-time graph to determine the speed of an object. To do so, consider a small part AB of the distance-time graph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel to the x-axis from point A and another line parallel to the y-axis from point B. These two lines meet each other at point C to form a triangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC denotes the time interval (t2 – t1) while BC corresponds to the distance (s2 – s1). We can see from the graph that as the object moves from the point A to B, it covers a distance (s2 – s1) in time (t2 – t1). The speed, v of the object, therefore can be represented as = 2 1 2 1 – – s s t t (7.4) We can also plot the distance-time graph for accelerated motion. Table 7.2 shows the distance travelled by a car in a time interval of two seconds.

        "The distance-time graph for the motion of the car is shown in Fig. 7.4. Note that the shape of this graph is different from the earlier distance-time graph (Fig. 7.3) for uniform motion. The nature of this graph shows non- linear variation of the distance travelled by the car with time. Thus, the graph shown in Fig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform speed. 7.4.2 VELOCITY-TIME GRAPHS The variation in velocity with time for an object moving in a straight line can be represented by a velocity-time graph. In this graph, time is represented along the x-axis and the velocity Fig. 7.4: Distance-time graph for a car moving with non-uniform speed Fig. 7.5: Velocity-time graph for uniform motion of a car",
        "is represented along the y-axis. If the object moves at uniform velocity, the height of its velocity-time graph will not change with time (Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to the x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time graph for a car moving with uniform velocity of 40 km h–1. We know that the product of velocity and time give displacement of an object moving with uniform velocity. The area enclosed by velocity-time graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement. To know the distance moved by the car between time t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw perpendiculars from the points corresponding to the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity of 40 km h–1 is represented by the height AC or BD and the time (t2 – t1) is represented by the length AB. So, the distance s moved by the car in time (t2 – t1) can be expressed as s = AC × CD = [(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h] = 40 (t2– t1) km = area of the rectangle ABDC (shaded in Fig. 7.5). We can also study about uniformly accelerated motion by plotting its velocity– time graph. Consider a car being driven along a straight road for testing its engine. Suppose a person sitting next to the driver records its velocity after every 5 seconds by noting the reading of the speedometer of the car. The velocity of the car, in km h–1 as well as in m s–1,  at different instants of time is shown in table 7.3.

The nature of the graph shows that velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time. Thus, for all uniformly accelerated motion, the velocity-time graph is a straight line. Fig. 7.6: Velocity-time graph for a car moving with uniform accelerations.",
        "You can also determine the distance moved by the car from its velocity-time graph. The area under the velocity-time graph gives the distance (magnitude of displacement) moved by the car in a given interval of time. If the car would have been moving with uniform velocity, the distance travelled by it would be represented by the area ABCD under the graph (Fig. 7.6). Since the magnitude of the velocity of the car is changing due to acceleration, the distance s travelled by the car will be given by the area ABCDE under the velocity-time graph (Fig. 7.6). That is, s = area ABCDE = area of the rectangle ABCD + area of the triangle ADE = AB × BC + 1 2 (AD × DE) In the case of non-uniformly accelerated motion, velocity-time graphs can have any shape. Fig. 7.7: Velocity-time graphs of an object in non- uniformly accelerated motion. Fig. 7.7(a) shows a velocity-time graph that represents the motion of an object whose velocity is decreasing with time while Fig. 7.7 (b) shows the velocity-time graph representing the non-uniform variation of velocity of the object with time.

        "When an object moves along a straight line with uniform acceleration, it is possible to relate its velocity, acceleration during motion and the distance covered by it in a certain time interval by a set of equations known as the equations of motion. For convenience, a set of three such equations are given below: v = u + at (7.5) s = ut + ½ at2 (7.6) 2 as = v2 – u2 (7.7) where u is the initial velocity of the object which moves with uniform acceleration a for time t, v is the final velocity, and s is the distance travelled by the object in time t. Eq. (7.5) describes the velocity-time relation and Eq. (7.6) represents the position-time relation. Eq. (7.7), which represents the relation between the position and the velocity, can be obtained from Eqs. (7.5) and (7.6) by eliminating t. These three equations can be derived by graphical method. Example 7.5 A train starting from rest attains a velocity of 72 km h–1 in 5 minutes. Assuming that the acceleration is uniform, find (i) the acceleration and (ii) the distance travelled by the train for attaining this velocity. Solution: We have been given u = 0 ; v = 72 km h–1 = 20 m s-1 and t = 5 minutes = 300 s. (i) From Eq. (7.5) we know that ( ) v – u a = t –1 –1 –2 20 m s – 0 m s = 300s 1 = m s 15"

In order to keep himself on track, he quickly changes his speed at the corners. How many times will the athlete have to change his direction of motion, while he completes one round? It is clear that to move in a rectangular track once, he has to change his direction of motion four times. Now, suppose instead of a rectangular track, the athlete is running along a hexagonal shaped path ABCDEF, as shown in Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will have to change his direction six times while he  completes one round. What if the track was not a hexagon but a regular octagon, with eight equal sides as shown by ABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that as the number of sides of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often. What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely? If you do this you will notice that the shape of the track approaches the shape of a circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path, the only change in his velocity is due to the change in the direction of motion. The motion of the athlete moving along a circular path is, therefore, an example of an accelerated motion. We know  that the circumference of a circle of radius r is given by π 2 r . If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r, the speed v is given by π 2 r v = t (7.8) When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.

Move the stone to describe a circular path with constant speed by holding the thread at the other end, as shown in Fig. 7.9. If you carefully note, on being released the stone moves along a straight line tangential to the circular path. This is because once the stone is released, it continues to move along the direction it has been moving at that instant. This shows that the direction of motion changed at every point when the stone was moving along the circular path. When an athlete throws a hammer or a discus in a sports meet, he/she holds the hammer or the discus in his/her hand and gives it a circular motion by rotating his/ her own body. Once released in the desired direction, the hammer or discus moves in the direction in which it was moving at the time it was released, just like the piece of stone in the activity described above.

  "full_text": "In everyday life, we see some objects at rest\nand others in motion. Birds fly, fish swim,\nblood flows through veins and arteries, and\ncars move. Atoms, molecules, planets, stars\nand galaxies are all in motion. We often\nperceive an object to be in motion when its\nposition changes with time. However, there\nare situations where the motion is inferred\nthrough indirect evidences. For example, we\ninfer the motion of air by observing the\nmovement of dust and the movement of leaves\nand branches of trees. What causes the\nphenomena of sunrise, sunset and changing\nof seasons? Is it due to the motion of the\nearth? If it is true, why don’t we directly\nperceive the motion of the earth?\nAn object may appear to be moving for\none person and stationary for some other. For\nthe passengers in a moving bus, the roadside\ntrees appear to be moving backwards. A\nperson standing on the road–side perceives\nthe bus alongwith the passengers as moving.\nHowever, a passenger inside the bus sees his\nfellow passengers to be at rest. What do these\nobservations indicate?\nMost motions are complex. Some objects\nmay move in a straight line, others may take\na circular path. Some may rotate and a few\nothers may vibrate. There may be situations\ninvolving a combination of these. In this\nchapter, we shall first learn to describe the\nmotion of objects along a straight line. We\nshall also learn to express such motions\nthrough simple equations and graphs. Later,\nwe shall discuss ways of describing\ncircular motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.1\n•\nDiscuss whether the walls of your\nclassroom are at rest or in motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.2\n•\nHave you ever experienced that the\ntrain in which you are sitting appears\nto move while it is at rest?\n•\nDiscuss and share your experience.\nThink and Act\nWe sometimes are endangered by the\nmotion of objects around us, especially\nif that motion is erratic and\nuncontrolled as observed in a flooded\nriver, a hurricane or a tsunami. On the\nother hand, controlled motion can be a\nservice to human beings such as in the\ngeneration of hydro-electric power. Do\nyou feel the necessity to study the\nerratic motion of some objects and\nlearn to control them?\n7.1 Describing Motion\nWe describe the location of an object by\nspecifying a reference point. Let us\nunderstand this by an example. Let us\nassume that a school in a village is 2 km north\nof the railway station. We have specified the\nposition of the school with respect to the\nrailway station. In this example, the railway\nstation is the reference point. We could have\nalso chosen other reference points according\nto our convenience. Therefore, to describe the\nposition of an object we need to specify a\nreference point called the origin.\n\nMOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 7.1.1 MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE\nThe simplest type of motion is the motion\nalong a straight line. We shall first learn to\ndescribe this by an example. Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its journey from O\nwhich is treated as its reference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n•\nTake a metre scale and a long rope.\n•\nWalk from one corner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite corner along its\nsides.\n•\nMeasure the distance covered by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n•\nWhat difference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n•\nAutomobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer. A\ncar is driven from Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The difference between the\nfinal reading and the initial reading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n•\nFind the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.\nThe total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance covered by the object. To\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the direction of\nmotion. There are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. From this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object from the initial\nposition O? This difference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject from O to C through A. The shortest\ndistance measured from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A, the distance\ncovered is 60 km and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance covered\nFig. 7.1: Positions of an object on a straight line path\n= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further, we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zero. However, the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km. Thus, two different physical\nquantities—the distance and the displacement,\nMOTION\n\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nuestions\n1.\nAn object has moved through a\ndistance.

Let it travel 5 m in the first second,\n5 m more in the next second, 5 m in the\nthird second and 5 m in the fourth second.\nIn this case, the object covers 5 m in each\nsecond. As the object covers equal distances\nin equal intervals of time, it is said to be in\nuniform motion. The time interval in this\nmotion should be small. In our day-to-day\nlife, we come across motions where objects\ncover unequal distances in equal intervals\nof time, for example, when a car is moving\non a crowded street or a person is jogging\nin a park. These are some instances of\nnon-uniform motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.5\n•\nThe data regarding the motion of two\ndifferent objects A and B are given in\nTable 7.1.\n•\nExamine them carefully and state\nwhether the motion of the objects is\nuniform or non-uniform.\nQ\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.2\nTable 7.1\nTime\nDistance\nDistance\ntravelled by\ntravelled by\nobject A in m\nobject B in m\n9:30 am\n\n\n9:45 am\n\n\n10:00 am\n\n\n10:15 am\n\n\n10:30 am\n\n\n10:45 am\n\n\n11:00 am\n\n\n7.2 Measuring the Rate of Motion\nReprint 2025-26 MOTION\n\nLook at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take different\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly. The rate at which objects move can\nbe different. Also, different objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is referred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metre per\nsecond. This is represented by the symbol\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre\nper hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we require only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\nmotion. Therefore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in terms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed = Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt\n(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h–1. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1 An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 s\nAverage speed = \nTotal distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= \n32 m\n6 s\n= 5.33 m s–1\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s–1.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be more\ncomprehensive if we specify its direction of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite direction. The velocity of an object\ncan be uniform or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object’s speed, direction of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan express the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in terms of average velocity. It is\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\naverage speed.\nIn case the velocity of the object is\nchanging at a uniform rate, then average\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\nperiod of time. That is,\naverage velocity = initial velocity + final velocity\n\nMathematically, v av = \nu + v\n\n(7.2)\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\nthat is, m s–1 or m/s.\nActivity ______________ 7.6\n•\nMeasure the time it takes you to walk\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\nthe school.

In this case, the change in velocity\nof the object for any time interval is zero.\nHowever, in non-uniform motion, velocity\nvaries with time. It has different values at\ndifferent instants and at different points of\nthe path.

For example, in the telecast of a\none-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs\nshow the run rate of a team in each over. As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables.\nTo describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs. In this case, line graphs\nshow dependence of one physical quantity,\nsuch as distance or velocity, on another\nquantity, such as time.\n7.4.1 DISTANCE–TIME GRAPHS\nThe change in the position of an object with\ntime can be represented on the distance-time\ngraph adopting a convenient scale of choice.\nIn this graph, time is taken along the x–axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis.\nDistance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc.\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith uniform speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed. This shows that the\ndistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform speed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis.\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the speed of an object. To do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B. These two\nlines meet each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC denotes\nthe time interval (t2 – t1) while BC corresponds\nto the distance (s2 – s1). We can see from the\ngraph that as the object moves from the point\nA to B, it covers a distance (s2 – s1) in time\n(t2 – t1). The speed, v of the object, therefore\ncan be represented as\n = \n\n\n\n\n–\n–\ns\ns\nt\nt\n(7.4)\nWe can also plot the distance-time graph\nfor accelerated motion.

Note that the\nshape of this graph is different from the earlier\ndistance-time graph (Fig. 7.3) for uniform\nmotion. The nature of this graph shows non-\nlinear variation of the distance travelled by\nthe car with time. Thus, the graph shown in\nFig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform\nspeed.\n7.4.2 VELOCITY-TIME GRAPHS\nThe variation in velocity with time for an object\nmoving in a straight line can be represented\nby a velocity-time graph. In this graph, time is\nrepresented along the x-axis and the velocity\nFig. 7.4: Distance-time graph for a car moving with\nnon-uniform speed\nFig. 7.5: Velocity-time graph for uniform motion\nof a car\nis represented along the y-axis. If the object\nmoves at uniform velocity, the height of its\nvelocity-time graph will not change with time\n(Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to\nthe x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time\ngraph for a car moving with uniform velocity\nof 40 km h–1.\nWe know that the product of velocity and\ntime give displacement of an object moving\nwith uniform velocity. The area enclosed by\nvelocity-time graph and the time axis will be\nequal to the magnitude of the displacement.\nTo know the distance moved by the car\nbetween time t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw\nperpendiculars from the points corresponding\nto the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity\nof 40 km h–1 is represented by the height AC\nor BD and the time (t2 – t1) is represented by\nthe length AB.\nSo, the distance s moved by the car in\ntime (t2 – t1) can be expressed as\ns = AC × CD\n= [(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h]\n= 40 (t2– t1) km\n= area of the rectangle ABDC (shaded\nin\nFig. 7.5).\nWe can also study about uniformly\naccelerated motion by plotting its velocity–\ntime graph. Consider a car being driven along\na straight road for testing its engine. Suppose\na person sitting next to the driver records its\nvelocity after every 5 seconds by noting the\nreading of the speedometer of the car. The\nvelocity of the car, in km h–1 as well as in\nm s–1, at different instants of time is shown\nin table 7.3.\nTable 7.3: Velocity of a car at\nregular instants of time\nTime\nVelocity of the car\n (s)\n(m s–1)\n(km h\n–1)\n\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n12.5\n\n\n15.0\n\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nIn this case, the velocity-time graph for the\nmotion of the car is shown in Fig. 7.6. The\nnature of the graph shows that velocity\nchanges by equal amounts in equal intervals\nof time. Thus, for all uniformly accelerated\nmotion, the velocity-time graph is a\nstraight line.\nFig. 7.6: Velocity-time graph for a car moving with\nuniform accelerations.\nYou can also determine the distance\nmoved by the car from its velocity-time graph.\nThe area under the velocity-time graph gives\nthe distance (magnitude of displacement)\nmoved by the car in a given interval of time.\nIf the car would have been moving with\nuniform velocity, the distance travelled by it\nwould be represented by the area ABCD\nunder the graph (Fig. 7.6). Since the\nmagnitude of the velocity of the car is\nchanging due to acceleration, the distance s\ntravelled by the car will be given by the area\nABCDE under the velocity-time graph\n(Fig. 7.6).\nThat is,\ns = area ABCDE\n= area of the rectangle ABCD + area of\nthe triangle ADE\n= AB × BC + \n\n2 (AD × DE)\nIn the case of non-uniformly accelerated\nmotion, velocity-time graphs can have any\nshape.\nFig. 7.7: Velocity-time graphs of an object in non-\nuniformly accelerated motion.\nFig. 7.7(a) shows a velocity-time graph that\nrepresents the motion of an object whose\nvelocity is decreasing with time while\nFig. 7.7 (b) shows the velocity-time graph\nrepresenting the non-uniform variation of\nvelocity of the object with time.

How many\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\nmotion four times.\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF, as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\nhave to change his direction six times while\nhe completes one round. What if the track\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)? It is observed that\nas the number of sides of the track increases\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\nalong the circular path, the only change in\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\nexample of an accelerated motion.\nWe know that the circumference of a circle\nof radius r is given by π\n2 r .

This is\nbecause once the stone is released, it\ncontinues to move along the direction it has\nbeen moving at that instant.
