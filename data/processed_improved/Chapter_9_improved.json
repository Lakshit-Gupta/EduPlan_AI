        "We know that the moon goes around the earth. An object when thrown upwards, reaches a certain height and then falls downwards. It is said that when Newton was sitting under a tree, an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the earth can attract an apple, can it not attract the moon? Is the force the same in both cases? He conjectured  that the same type of force is responsible in both the cases. He argued that at each point of its orbit, the moon falls towards the earth, instead of going off in a straight line. So, it must be attracted by the earth. But we do not really see the moon falling towards the earth.",

        "Before the thread is released, the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point. The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration. The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre. This force is called the centripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force."

        "A straight line that meets the circle at one and only one point is called a tangent to the circle. Straight line ABC is a tangent to the circle at point B.",
        "The motion of the moon around the earth is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of the earth. If there were no such force, the moon would pursue a uniform straight line motion. It is seen that a falling apple is attracted towards the earth. Does the apple attract the earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving towards an apple. Why? According to the third law of motion, the apple does attract the earth. But according to the second law of motion, for a given force, acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving towards the apple. Extend the same argument for why the earth does not move towards the moon. In our solar system, all the planets go around the Sun. By arguing the same way, we can say that there exists a force between the Sun and the planets. From the above facts Newton concluded that not only does the earth attract an apple and the moon, but all objects in the universe attract each other. This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force.",

But due to the earth’s attraction, there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity. Any change in velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an object falls towards the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by g. The unit of g is the same as that of acceleration, that is, m s–2. We know from the second law of motion that force is the product of mass and acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in activity 9.2 be m. We already know that there is acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational force and is denoted by g.

The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, that is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at a given place, we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass.

We have learnt\nthat a force is needed to change the speed or\nthe direction of motion of an object. We always\nobserve that an object dropped from a height\nfalls towards the earth. We know that all the\nplanets go around the Sun. The moon goes\naround the earth. In all these cases, there must\nbe some force acting on the objects, the planets\nand on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp\nthat the same force is responsible for all these.\nThis force is called the gravitational force.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\ngravitation and the universal law of\ngravitation. We shall discuss the motion of\nobjects under the influence of gravitational\nforce on the earth. We shall study how the\nweight of a body varies from place to place.\nWe shall also discuss the conditions for\nobjects to float in liquids.\n9.1 Gravitation\nWe know that the moon goes around the earth.\nAn object when thrown upwards, reaches a\ncertain height and then falls downwards. It is\nsaid that when Newton was sitting under a tree,\nan apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made\nNewton start thinking. He thought that: if the\nearth can attract an apple, can it not attract\nthe moon? Is the force the same in both cases?\nHe conjectured that the same type of force is\nresponsible in both the cases. He argued that\nat each point of its orbit, the moon falls\ntowards the earth, instead of going off in a\nstraight line. So, it must be attracted by the\nearth. But we do not really see the moon falling\ntowards the earth.\nLet us try to understand the motion of the\nmoon by recalling activity 7.11.\nActivity ______________ 9.1\n•\nTake a piece of thread.\n•\nTie a small stone at one end. Hold the\nother end of the thread and whirl it\nround, as shown in Fig. 9.1.\n•\nNote the motion of the stone.\n•\nRelease the thread.\n•\nAgain, note the direction of motion of\nthe stone.\nFig. 9.1:\nA stone describing a circular path with a\nvelocity of constant magnitude.\nBefore the thread is released, the stone\nmoves in a circular path with a certain speed\nand changes direction at every point.\nThe change in direction involves change in\nvelocity or acceleration. The force that causes\nthis acceleration and keeps the body moving\nalong the circular path is acting towards\nthe centre. This force is called the\ncentripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force.\n\nGRAVITATION\nRAVITATION\nRAVITATION\nRAVITATION\nRAVITATION\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 GRAVITATION\n\n9.1.1 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION\nEvery object in the universe attracts every\nother object with a force which is proportional\nto the product of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance\nbetween them. The force is along the line\njoining the centres of two objects.\nIn the absence of this force, the stone flies off\nalong a straight line. This straight line will be\na tangent to the circular path.\nMore to know\nTangent to a circle\nA straight line that meets the circle at\none and only one point is called a\ntangent to the circle. Straight line\nABC is a tangent to the circle at\npoint B.\nThe motion of the moon around the earth\nis due to the centripetal force. The centripetal\nforce is provided by the force of attraction of\nthe earth. If there were no such force, the\nmoon would pursue a uniform straight line\nmotion.\nIt is seen that a falling apple is attracted\ntowards the earth. Does the apple attract the\nearth? If so, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards an apple. Why?\nAccording to the third law of motion, the\napple does attract the earth. But according\nto the second law of motion, for a given force,\nacceleration is inversely proportional to the\nmass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an\napple is negligibly small compared to that of\nthe earth. So, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards the apple. Extend the same argument\nfor why the earth does not move towards the\nmoon.\nIn our solar system, all the planets go\naround the Sun. By arguing the same way,\nwe can say that there exists a force between\nthe Sun and the planets. From the above facts\nNewton concluded that not only does the\nearth attract an apple and the moon, but all\nobjects in the universe attract each other. This\nforce of attraction between objects is called\nthe gravitational force.\nG\n\nMm\nF =\nd\nFig. 9.2:\nThe gravitational force between two\nuniform objects is directed along the line\njoining their centres.\nLet two objects A and B of masses M and\nm lie at a distance d from each other as shown\nin Fig. 9.2.

(9.9), namely,\nuniversal gravitational constant, G = 6.7 × 10–11\nN m2 kg-2, mass of the earth, M = 6 × 1024 kg,\nand radius of the earth, R = 6.4 × 106 m.\nG\n\nM\ng =\nR\n-11\n\n-2\n\n\n\n6.7\n\nN m kg\n6 10\nkg\n=\n(6.4 10 m)\n×\n×\n×\n×\n = 9.8 m s–2.\nThus, the value of acceleration due to gravity\nof the earth, g = 9.8 m s–2.\n9.2.2 MOTION OF OBJECTS UNDER THE\nINFLUENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL\nFORCE OF THE EARTH\nLet us do an activity to understand whether\nall objects hollow or solid, big or small, will\nfall from a height at the same rate.\nActivity 9.3\n•\nTake a sheet of paper and a stone.\nDrop them simultaneously from the\nfirst floor of a building. Observe\nwhether both of them reach the\nground simultaneously.\n•\nWe see that paper reaches the ground\nlittle later than the stone. This happens\nbecause of air resistance. The air offers\nresistance due to friction to the motion\nof the falling objects. The resistance\noffered by air to the paper is more than\nthe resistance offered to the stone. If\nwe do the experiment in a glass jar\nfrom which air has been sucked out,\nthe paper and the stone would fall at\nthe same rate.\nchange in the velocity of falling objects? While\nfalling, there is no change in the direction of\nmotion of the objects. But due to the earth’s\nattraction, there will be a change in the\nmagnitude of the velocity. Any change in\nvelocity involves acceleration. Whenever an\nobject falls towards the earth, an acceleration\nis involved. This acceleration is due to the\nearth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this\nacceleration is called the acceleration due to\nthe gravitational force of the earth (or\nacceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by\ng. The unit of g is the same as that of\nacceleration, that is, m s–2.\nWe know from the second law of motion\nthat force is the product of mass and\nacceleration. Let the mass of the stone in\nactivity 9.2 be m. We already know that there\nis acceleration involved in falling objects due\nto the gravitational force and is denoted by g.\nTherefore the magnitude of the gravitational\nforce F will be equal to the product of mass\nand acceleration due to the gravitational\nforce, that is,\nF = m g\n(9.6)\nFrom Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have\n\n= G\n×\nM\nm\nm g\nd\nor\nG\n\nM\ng =\nd\n(9.7)\nwhere M is the mass of the earth, and d is the\ndistance between the object and the earth.\nLet an object be on or near the surface of\nthe earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) will be\nequal to R, the radius of the earth. Thus, for\nobjects on or near the surface of the earth,\nG\n\nM × m\nmg =\nR\n(9.8)\n \nG\n\nM\ng =\nR\n(9.9)\nThe earth is not a perfect sphere. As the\nradius of the earth increases from the poles to\nthe equator, the value of g becomes greater at\nthe poles than at the equator. For most\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nWe know that an object experiences\nacceleration during free fall. From Eq. (9.9),\nthis acceleration experienced by an object is\nindependent of its mass. This means that all\nobjects hollow or solid, big or small, should\nfall at the same rate. According to a story,\nGalileo dropped different objects from the top\nof the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy to prove\nthe same.\nAs g is constant near the earth, all the\nequations for the uniformly accelerated\nmotion of objects become valid with\nacceleration \na \nreplaced \nby \ng.\nThe equations are:\nv = u + at\n(9.10)\ns = ut + 1\n2 at2\n(9.11)\nv2 = u2 + 2as\n(9.12)\nwhere u and v are the initial and final velocities\nand s is the distance covered in time, t.\nIn applying these equations, we will take\nacceleration, a to be positive when it is in the\ndirection of the velocity, that is, in the\ndirection of motion. The acceleration, a will\nbe taken as negative when it opposes the\nmotion.\nExample 9.2 A car falls off a ledge and\ndrops to the ground in 0.5 s. Let\ng = 10 m s –2 (for simplifying the\ncalculations).\n(i) What is its speed on striking the\nground?\n(ii) What is its average speed during the\n0.5 s?\n(iii) How high is the ledge from the\nground?\nSolution:\n Time, t = ½ second\nInitial velocity, u = 0 m s–1\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 10 m s–2\nAcceleration of the car, a = + 10 m s–2\n (downward)\n(i) speed v\n=\na t\n v\n=\n10 m s–2 × 0.5 s\n=\n5 m s–1\n(ii)\naverage speed=\n\nu +v\n=\n(0 m s–1+ 5 m s–1)/2\n=\n2.5 m s–1\n(iii) distance travelled, s = ½ a t2\n= ½ × 10 m s–2 × (0.5 s)2\n= ½ × 10 m s–2 × 0.25 s2\n= 1.25 m\nThus,\n(i)\nits speed on striking the ground\n= 5 m s–1\n(ii)\nits average speed during the 0.5 s\n= 2.5 m s–1\n(iii) height of the ledge from the ground\n= 1.25 m.\nExample 9.3 An object is thrown vertically\nupwards and rises to a height of 10 m.\nCalculate (i) the velocity with which the\nobject was thrown upwards and (ii) the\ntime taken by the object to reach the\nhighest point.\nSolution:\nDistance travelled, s = 10 m\nFinal velocity, v = 0 m s–1\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2\nAcceleration of the object, a = –9.8 m s–2\n(upward motion)\n(i)\nv 2 = u2 + 2a s\n0 = u 2 + 2 × (–9.8 m s–2) × 10 m\n–u 2 = –2 × 9.8 × 10 m2 s–2\nu = 196 m s-1\n u = 14 m s-1\n(ii)\nv = u + a t\n0 = 14 m s–1 – 9.8 m s–2 × t\nt = 1.43 s.\nThus,\n(i)\nInitial velocity, u = 14 m s–1, and\n(ii)\nTime taken, t = 1.43 s.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat do you mean by free fall?\n2.\nWhat do you mean by acceleration\ndue to gravity?\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 GRAVITATION\n\n9.3 Mass\nWe have learnt in the previous chapter that the\nmass of an object is the measure of its inertia .\nWe have also learnt that greater the mass, the\ngreater is the inertia. It remains the same\nwhether the object is on the earth, the moon\nor even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an\nobject is constant and does not change from\nplace to place.\n9.4 Weight\nWe know that the earth attracts every object\nwith a certain force and this force depends on\nthe mass (m) of the object and the acceleration\ndue to the gravity (g). The weight of an object\nis the force with which it is attracted towards\nthe earth.\nWe know that\nF = m × a,\n(9.13)\nthat is,\nF = m × g.\n(9.14)\nThe force of attraction of the earth on an\nobject is known as the weight of the object. It\nis denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq.\n(9.14), we have\nW = m × g\n(9.15)\nAs the weight of an object is the force with\nwhich it is attracted towards the earth, the SI\nunit of weight is the same as that of force, that\nis, newton (N). The weight is a force acting\nvertically downwards; it has both magnitude\nand direction.\nWe have learnt that the value of g is\nconstant at a given place. Therefore at a given\nplace, the weight of an object is directly\nproportional to the mass, say m, of the object,\nthat is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at\na given place, we can use the weight of an\nobject as a measure of its mass. The mass of\nan object remains the same everywhere, that\nis, on the earth and on any planet whereas its\nweight depends on its location because g\ndepends on location.\n9.4.1 WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT ON\nTHE MOON\nWe have learnt that the weight of an object on\nthe earth is the force with which the earth\nattracts the object. In the same way, the weight\nof an object on the moon is the force with\nwhich the moon attracts that object. The mass\nof the moon is less than that of the earth. Due\nto this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction\non objects.\nLet the mass of an object be m. Let its\nweight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of\nthe moon be Mm and its radius be Rm.\nBy applying the universal law of\ngravitation, the weight of the object on the\nmoon will be\n\nG\n×\n=\nm\nm\nm\nM\nm\nW\nR\n(9.16)\nLet the weight of the same object on the\nearth be We.

Why an army tank weighing\nmore than a thousand tonne rests upon a\ncontinuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus\nhas much wider tyres? Why cutting tools have\nsharp edges? In order to address these\nquestions and understand the phenomena\ninvolved, it helps to introduce the concepts\nof the net force in a particular direction (thrust)\nand the force per unit area (pressure) acting\non the object concerned.\nLet us try to understand the meanings of\nthrust and pressure by considering the\nfollowing situations:\nSituation 1: You wish to fix a poster on a\nbulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this\ntask you will have to press drawing pins with\nyour thumb. You apply a force on the surface\narea of the head of the pin. This force is directed\nperpendicular to the surface area of the board.\nThis force acts on a smaller area at the tip of\nthe pin.\nQ\nFig. 9.3:\nTo fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed\nwith the thumb perpendicular to the board.\nSituation 2: You stand on loose sand. Your\nfeet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on\nthe sand. You will find that your body will not\ngo that deep in the sand. In both cases the\nforce exerted on the sand is the weight of your\nbody.\nReprint 2025-26 GRAVITATION\n\nYou have learnt that weight is the force\nacting vertically downwards. Here the force is\nacting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.\nThe force acting on an object perpendicular to\nthe surface is called thrust.\nWhen you stand on loose sand, the force,\nthat is, the weight of your body is acting on\nan area equal to area of your feet. When you\nlie down, the same force acts on an area equal\nto the contact area of your whole body, which\nis larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the\neffects of forces of the same magnitude on\ndifferent areas are different. In the above\ncases, thrust is the same. But effects are\ndifferent. Therefore the effect of thrust\ndepends on the area on which it acts.\nThe effect of thrust on sand is larger while\nstanding than while lying. The thrust on unit\narea is called pressure. Thus,\nthrust\nPressure=\narea\n(9.20)\nSubstituting the SI unit of thrust and area in\nEq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/\nm2 or N m–2.\nIn honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the\nSI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted\nas Pa.\nLet us consider a numerical example to\nunderstand the effects of thrust acting on\ndifferent areas.\nExample 9.6 A block of wood is kept on a\ntabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5\nkg and its dimensions are 40 cm × 20\ncm × 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted\nby the wooden block on the table top if\nit is made to lie on the table top with its\nsides of dimensions (a) 20 cm × 10 cm\nand (b) 40 cm × 20 cm.\nSolution:\nThe mass of the wooden block = 5 kg\nThe dimensions\n= 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm\nHere, the weight of the wooden block\napplies a thrust on the table top.\nThat is,\n Thrust = F = m × g\n= 5 kg × 9.8 m s–2\n= 49 N\nArea of a side = length × breadth\n= 20 cm × 10 cm\n= 200 cm2 = 0.02 m2\nFrom Eq. (9.20),\nPressure = \n\n49N\n0.02m\n= 2450 N m-2.\nWhen the block lies on its side of\ndimensions 40 cm × 20 cm, it exerts\nthe same thrust.\nArea=\nlength × breadth\n=\n40 cm × 20 cm\n=\n800 cm2 = 0.08 m2\nFrom Eq. (9.20),\nPressure =\n\n49 N\n0.08 m\n= 612.5 N m–2\nThe pressure exerted by the side 20 cm\n× 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side\n40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2.\nThus, the same force acting on a smaller\narea exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller\npressure on a larger area. This is the reason\nwhy a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp\nedges and buildings have wide foundations.\n9.5.1 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS\nAll liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts\npressure on a surface due to its weight.\nSimilarly, fluids have weight, and they also\nFig. 9.4\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nwater on the bottle is greater than its weight.\nTherefore it rises up when released.\nTo keep the bottle completely immersed,\nthe upward force on the bottle due to water\nmust be balanced. This can be achieved by\nan externally applied force acting downwards.\nThis force must at least be equal to the\ndifference between the upward force and the\nweight of the bottle.\nThe upward force exerted by the water on\nthe bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant\nforce. In fact, all objects experience a force of\nbuoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid.\nThe magnitude of this buoyant force depends\non the density of the fluid.\n9.5.3 WHY OBJECTS FLOAT OR SINK\nWHEN PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF\nWATER?\nLet us do the following activities to arrive at\nan answer for the above question.\nActivity ______________ 9.5\n•\nTake a beaker filled with water.\n•\nTake an iron nail and place it on the\nsurface of the water.\n•\nObserve what happens.\nThe nail sinks. The force due to the\ngravitational attraction of the earth on the\niron nail pulls it downwards. There is an\nupthrust of water on the nail, which pushes\nit upwards. But the downward force acting\non the nail is greater than the upthrust of\nwater on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 9.5).\nexert pressure on the base and walls of the\ncontainer in which they are enclosed. Pressure\nexerted in any confined mass of fluid is\ntransmitted undiminished in all directions.\n9.5.2 BUOYANCY\nHave you ever had a swim in a pool and felt\nlighter? Have you ever drawn water from a\nwell and felt that the bucket of water is heavier\nwhen it is out of the water? Have you ever\nwondered why a ship made of iron and steel\ndoes not sink in sea water, but while the same\namount of iron and steel in the form of a sheet\nwould sink? These questions can be answered\nby taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us\nunderstand the meaning of buoyancy by\ndoing an activity.\nActivity ______________ 9.4\n•\nTake an empty plastic bottle. Close\nthe mouth of the bottle with an\nairtight stopper. Put it in a bucket\nfilled with water. You see that the\nbottle floats.\n•\nPush the bottle into the water. You feel\nan upward push. Try to push it further\ndown. You will find it difficult to push\ndeeper and deeper. This indicates that\nwater exerts a force on the bottle in the\nupward direction. The upward force\nexerted by the water goes on increasing\nas the bottle is pushed deeper till it is\ncompletely immersed.\n•\nNow, release the bottle. It bounces\nback to the surface.\n•\nDoes the force due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth act on this\nbottle? If so, why doesn’t the bottle stay\nimmersed in water after it is released?\nHow can you immerse the bottle in\nwater?\nThe force due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth acts on the bottle in\nthe downward direction. So the bottle is\npulled downwards. But the water exerts an\nupward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is\npushed upwards. We have learnt that weight\nof an object is the force due to gravitational\nattraction of the earth. When the bottle is\nimmersed, the upward force exerted by the\nFig. 9.5:\nAn iron nail sinks and a cork floats when\nplaced on the surface of water.\nReprint 2025-26 GRAVITATION\n\n•\nObserve what happens to elongation\nof the string or the reading on the\nbalance.\nYou will find that the elongation of the string\nor the reading of the balance decreases as the\nstone is gradually lowered in the water. However,\nno further change is observed once the stone\ngets fully immersed in the water. What do you\ninfer from the decrease in the extension of the\nstring or the reading of the spring balance?\nWe know that the elongation produced in\nthe string or the spring balance is due to the\nweight of the stone. Since the extension\ndecreases once the stone is lowered in water,\nit means that some force acts on the stone in\nupward direction. As a result, the net force on\nthe string decreases and hence the elongation\nalso decreases. As discussed earlier, this\nupward force exerted by water is known as\nthe force of buoyancy.\nWhat is the magnitude of the buoyant\nforce experienced by a body? Is it the same\nin all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies\nin a given fluid experience the same buoyant\nforce? The answer to these questions is\ncontained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as\nfollows:\nActivity ______________ 9.6\n•\nTake a beaker filled with water.\n•\nTake a piece of cork and an iron nail of\nequal mass.\n•\nPlace them on the surface of water.\n•\nObserve what happens.\nThe cork floats while the nail sinks. This\nhappens because of the difference in their\ndensities. The density of a substance is\ndefined as the mass per unit volume. The\ndensity of cork is less than the density of\nwater. This means that the upthrust of water\non the cork is greater than the weight of the\ncork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5).\nThe density of an iron nail is more than\nthe density of water. This means that the\nupthrust of water on the iron nail is less than\nthe weight of the nail. So it sinks.\nTherefore objects of density less than that\nof a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of\ndensity greater than that of a liquid sink in\nthe liquid.\nuestions\n1.\nWhy is it difficult to hold a school\nbag having a strap made of a thin\nand strong string?\n2.\nWhat do you mean by buoyancy?\n3.\nWhy does an object float or sink\nwhen placed on the surface of\nwater?\n9.6 Archimedes’ Principle\nActivity ______________ 9.7\n•\nTake a piece of stone and tie it to one\nend of a rubber string or a spring\nbalance.\n•\nSuspend the stone by holding the\nbalance or the string as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (a).\n•\n Note the elongation of the string or\nthe reading on the spring balance due\nto the weight of the stone.\n•\nNow, slowly dip the stone in the water\nin a container as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (b).\nFig. 9.6: (a) Observe the elongation of the rubber\nstring due to the weight of a piece of stone\nsuspended from it in air. (b) The elongation\ndecreases as the stone is immersed\nin water.\n(a)\n(b)\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nThe law of gravitation states that the force of attraction\nbetween any two objects is proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the square of\nthe distance between them. The law applies to objects\nanywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be universal.\n•\nGravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.\n•\nThe force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies\non the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the\nequator.\n•\nThe weight of a body is the force with which the earth\nattracts it.\n•\nThe weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration\ndue to gravity.\n•\nThe weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays\nconstant.\nWhen a body is immersed fully or partially\nin a fluid, it experiences an upward force that\nis equal to the weight of the fluid displaced\nby it.\nNow, can you explain why a further\ndecrease in the elongation of the string was\nnot observed in activity 9.7, as the stone was\nfully immersed in water?\nArchimedes was a Greek scientist. He\ndiscovered the principle, subsequently named\nafter him, after noticing that\nthe water in a bathtub\noverflowed when he stepped\ninto it. He ran through the\nstreets shouting “Eureka!”,\nwhich means “I have got it”.\nThis knowledge helped him to\ndetermine the purity of the\ngold in the crown made for\nthe king.\nHis work in the field of Geometry and\nMechanics made him famous.
