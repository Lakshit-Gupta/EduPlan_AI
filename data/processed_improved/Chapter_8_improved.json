        "box with a small force, the box does not move because of friction acting in a direction opposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction force arises between two surfaces in contact; in this case, between the bottom of the box and floor’s rough surface. It balances the pushing force and therefore the box does not move. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box harder but the box still does not move. This is because the friction force still balances the pushing force. If the children push the box harder still, the pushing force becomes bigger than the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box starts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins to slow down. This is again because of the friction forces acting opposite to the direction of motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving, we have to start pedalling again. It thus appears that an  object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an unbalanced force. However, it is quite incorrect. An object moves with a uniform velocity when the forces (pushing force and frictional force) acting on the object are balanced and there is no net external force on it. If an unbalanced force is applied on the object, there will be a change either in its speed or in the direction of its motion. Thus, to accelerate the motion of an object, an unbalanced force is required. And the change in its speed (or in the direction of motion) would continue as long as this unbalanced force is applied. However, if this force is"

        "Fig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown. If we apply a force by pulling the string X, the block begins to move to the right. Similarly, if we pull the string Y, the block moves to the left. But, if the block is pulled from both the sides with equal forces, the block will not move. Such forces are called balanced forces and do not change the state of rest or of motion of an object. Now, let us consider a situation in which two opposite forces of different magnitudes pull the block. In this case, the block would begin to move in the direction of the greater force. Thus, the two forces are not balanced and the unbalanced force acts in the direction the block moves. This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion.",

        "By observing the motion of objects on an inclined plane Galileo deduced that objects move with a constant speed when no force acts on them. He observed that when a marble rolls down an inclined plane, its velocity increases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you will learn that the marble falls under the unbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down and attains a definite velocity by the time it reaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases when it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both sides. Galileo argued that when the marble is released from left, it would roll down the slope and go up on the opposite side to the same height from which it was released. If the inclinations of the planes on both sides are equal then the marble will climb the same distance that it covered while rolling down. If the angle of inclination of the right-side plane were gradually decreased, then the marble would travel further distances till it reaches the original height. If the right-side plane were ultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope is reduced to zero), the marble would continue to travel forever trying to reach the same height that it was released from. The unbalanced forces on the marble in this case are zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced (external) force is required to change the motion of the marble but no net force is needed to sustain the uniform motion of the marble.  In practical situations it is difficult to achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is because of the presence of the frictional force acting opposite to the direction of motion. Thus, in practice the marble stops after travelling some distance. The effect of the frictional force may be minimised by using a smooth marble and a smooth plane and providing a lubricant on top of the planes.",

        "Newton further studied Galileo’s ideas on force and motion and presented three fundamental laws that govern the motion of objects. These three laws are known as Newton’s laws of motion. The first law of motion is stated as: An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force. In other words, all objects resist a change in their state of motion. In a qualitative way, the tendency of undisturbed objects to stay at rest or to keep moving with the same velocity is called inertia. This is why, the first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia. Certain experiences that we come across while travelling in a motorcar can be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to remain at rest with respect to the seat until the driver applies a braking force to stop the motorcar. With the application of brakes, the car slows down but our body tends to continue in the same state of motion because of its inertia. A sudden application of brakes may thus cause injury to us by impact",

An opposite experience is encountered when we are standing in a bus and the bus begins to move suddenly. Now we tend to fall backwards. This is because the sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as to our feet in contact with the floor of the bus. But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to continue in our straight-line motion. When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motorcar, we slip to one side of the seat due to the inertia of our body. The fact that a body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force can  be  illustrated  through  the following activities:"

        "Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa, Italy. Galileo, right from his childhood, had interest in mathematics and natural philosophy. But  his  father Vincenzo Galilei wanted him to become a medical doctor.  Accordingly, Galileo enrolled himself for a medical degree at the University of Pisa in 1581 which he never completed because of his real interest in mathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first scientific book ‘The Little Balance [La Balancitta]’, in which he described Archimedes’ method of finding the relative densities (or specific gravities) of substances using a balance. In 1589, in his series of essays – De Motu, he presented his theories about falling objects using an inclined plane to slow down the rate of descent. In 1592, he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Padua in the Republic of Venice. Here he continued his observations on the theory of motion and through his study of inclined planes and the pendulum, formulated the correct law for uniformly accelerated objects that the distance the object moves is proportional to the square of the time taken. Galileo was also a remarkable craftsman. He developed a series of telescopes whose optical performance was much better than that of other telescopes available during those days. Around 1640, he designed the first pendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry Messenger’ on his astronomical discoveries, Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the moon, the milky way made up of tiny stars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. In his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’ and ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed his observations of sunspots. Using his own telescopes and through his observations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo argued that all the planets must orbit the Sun and not the earth, contrary to what was believed at that time.",

A force that is just enough to cause a small cart to pick up a large velocity will produce a negligible change in the motion of a train. This is because, in comparison to the cart the train has a much lesser tendency to change its state of motion. Accordingly, we say that the train has more inertia than the cart. Clearly, heavier or more massive objects offer larger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an object is measured by its mass. We may thus relate inertia and mass as follows: Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to resist a change in its state of motion or of rest. The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia."

If it is at rest it tends to remain at rest; if it is moving it tends to keep moving. This property of an object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have the same inertia? We know that it is easier to push an empty box than a box full of books. Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away. But if we kick a stone of the same size with equal force, it hardly moves.

        "its velocity changes, that is, the object gets an acceleration. We would now like to study how the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and how we measure a force. Let us recount some observations from our everyday life. During the game of table tennis if the ball hits a player it does not hurt him. On the other hand, when a fast moving cricket ball hits a spectator, it may hurt him. A truck at rest does not require any attention when parked along a roadside. But a moving truck, even at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a person standing in its path. A small mass, such as a bullet may kill a person when fired from a gun. These observations suggest that the impact produced by the objects depends on their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an object is to be accelerated, we know that a greater force is required to give a greater velocity. In other words, there appears to exist some quantity of importance that combines the object’s mass and its velocity. One such property called momentum was introduced by Newton. The momentum, p of an object is defined as the product of its mass, m and velocity, v. That is, p = mv (8.1)",
        "Momentum has both direction and magnitude. Its direction is the same as that of velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram-metre per second (kg m s-1). Since the application of an unbalanced force brings a change in the velocity of the object, it is therefore clear that a force also produces a change of momentum. Let us consider a situation in which a car with a dead battery is to be pushed along a straight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which is sufficient to start its engine. If one or two persons give a sudden push (unbalanced force) to it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push over some time results in a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed. It means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted. It may then also be concluded that the force necessary to change the momentum of an object depends",

        "motion gives us a method to measure the force acting on an object as a product of its mass and acceleration. The second law of motion is often seen in action in our everyday life. Have you noticed that while catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball? In doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is also reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic event, the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to increase the time of the athlete’s fall to stop after making the jump. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force. Try to ponder how a karate player breaks a slab of ice with a single blow.",

        "The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied force changes the motion and provide us with a method of determining the force. The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other. In other words, there is a pair of forces and not just one force. The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction. This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously.",

Is it the muscular effort you exert on the road? Is it in the direction we intend to move? No, you push the road below backwards. The road exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward. It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes. This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards (Fig. 8.12).",

  "full_text": "In the previous chapter, we described the\nmotion of an object along a straight line in\nterms of its position, velocity and acceleration.\nWe saw that such a motion can be uniform\nor non-uniform. We have not yet discovered\nwhat causes the motion. Why does the speed\nof an object change with time? Do all motions\nrequire a cause? If so, what is the nature of\nthis cause? In this chapter we shall make an\nattempt to quench all such curiosities.\nFor many centuries, the problem of\nmotion and its causes had puzzled scientists\nand philosophers. A ball on the ground, when\ngiven a small hit, does not move forever. Such\nobservations suggest that rest is the “natural\nstate” of an object. This remained the belief\nuntil Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton\ndeveloped an entirely different approach to\nunderstand motion.\nIn our everyday life we observe that some\neffort is required to put a stationary object\ninto motion or to stop a moving object. We\nordinarily experience this as a muscular effort\nand say that we must push or hit or pull on\nan object to change its state of motion. The\nconcept of force is based on this push, hit or\npull. Let us now ponder about a ‘force’. What\nis it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a\nforce. However, we always see or feel the effect\nof a force. It can only be explained by\ndescribing what happens when a force is\napplied to an object. Pushing, hitting and\npulling of objects are all ways of bringing\nobjects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because\nwe make a force act on them.\nFrom your studies in earlier classes, you\nare also familiar with the fact that a force can\nbe used to change the magnitude of velocity\nof an object (that is, to make the object move\nfaster or slower) or to change its direction of\nmotion. We also know that a force can change\nthe shape and size of objects (Fig. 8.2).\n(a) The trolley moves along the\ndirection we push it.\n(c) The hockey stick hits the ball forward\n(b) The drawer is pulled.\nFig. 8.1: Pushing, pulling, or hitting objects change\ntheir state of motion.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.2: (a) A spring expands on application of force;\n(b) A spherical rubber ball becomes oblong\n as we apply force on it.\n\nFORCE\nORCE\nORCE\nORCE\nORCE AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND L\n L\n L\n L\n LAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF M\n M\n M\n M\n MOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nOTION\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nbox with a small force, the box does not move\nbecause of friction acting in a direction\nopposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction\nforce arises between two surfaces in contact;\nin this case, between the bottom of the box\nand floor’s rough surface. It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)].\nThere is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving.\nWhat happens when we ride a bicycle?\nWhen we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction forces acting opposite to the direction\nof motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced force. However, it is quite\nincorrect. An object moves with a uniform\nvelocity when the forces (pushing force and\nfrictional force) acting on the object are\nbalanced and there is no net external force\non it. If an unbalanced force is applied on\nthe object, there will be a change either in its\nspeed or in the direction of its motion. Thus,\nto accelerate the motion of an object, an\nunbalanced force is required. And the change\nin its speed (or in the direction of motion)\nwould continue as long as this unbalanced\nforce is applied. However, if this force is\n8.1 Balanced and Unbalanced\nForces\nFig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal\ntable. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two\nopposite faces of the block as shown. If we\napply a force by pulling the string X, the block\nbegins to move to the right. Similarly, if we\npull the string Y, the block moves to the left.\nBut, if the block is pulled from both the sides\nwith equal forces, the block will not move.\nSuch forces are called balanced forces and\ndo not change the state of rest or of motion of\nan object. Now, let us consider a situation in\nwhich two opposite forces of different\nmagnitudes pull the block. In this case, the\nblock would begin to move in the direction of\nthe greater force. Thus, the two forces are\nnot balanced and the unbalanced force acts\nin the direction the block moves. This\nsuggests that an unbalanced force acting on\nan object brings it in motion.\nFig. 8.3: Two forces acting on a wooden block\nWhat happens when some children try to\npush a box on a rough floor? If they push the\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 8.4\nReprint 2025-26 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION\n\nremoved completely, the object would continue\nto move with the velocity it has acquired till\nthen.\n8.2 First Law of Motion\nBy observing the motion of objects on an\ninclined plane Galileo deduced that objects\nmove with a constant speed when no force\nacts on them. He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\nGalileo argued that when the marble is\nreleased from left, it would roll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight from which it was released. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides are\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it covered while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decreased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it reaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane were\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zero), the marble would continue\nto travel forever trying to reach the same\nheight that it was released from. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(external) force is required to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net force is\nneeded to sustain the uniform motion of the\nmarble. In practical situations it is difficult\nto achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional force\nacting opposite to the direction of motion.\nThus, in practice the marble stops after\ntravelling some distance. The effect of the\nfrictional force may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes.\nFig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane.\nNewton further studied Galileo’s ideas on\nforce and motion and presented three\nfundamental laws that govern the motion of\nobjects. These three laws are known as\nNewton’s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object remains in a state of rest or of\nuniform motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force.\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion. In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia.\nCertain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motorcar can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\nWe tend to remain at rest with respect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking force\nto stop the motorcar. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nor collision with the panels in front. Safety belts\nare worn to prevent such accidents. Safety belts\nexert a force on our body to make the forward\nmotion slower. An opposite experience is\nencountered when we are standing in a bus\nand the bus begins to move suddenly. Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia.\nWhen a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side.\nThis can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. We tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motorcar, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.\nThe fact that a body will remain at rest\nunless acted upon by an unbalanced force\ncan \nbe \nillustrated \nthrough \nthe\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 8.1\n•\nMake a pile of similar carom coins on\na table, as shown in Fig. 8.6.\n•\nAttempt a sharp horizontal hit at the\nbottom of the pile using another carom\ncoin or the striker. If the hit is strong\nenough, the bottom coin moves out\nquickly. Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them ‘fall’ vertically on the\ntable.\nGalileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut \nhis \nfather\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor. \nAccordingly,\nGalileo enrolled himself\nfor a medical degree at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his real interest in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first\nscientific book ‘The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta]’, in which he described\nArchimedes’ method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays – De Motu, he presented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed professor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of Venice. Here he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, formulated the correct law for\nuniformly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is proportional to\nthe square of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a remarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical performance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Around 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry\nMessenger’ on his astronomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter.\nIn his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’\nand ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and through his\nobservations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 – 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\nReprint 2025-26 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION\n\nfive-rupees coin if we use a one-rupee coin, we\nfind that a lesser force is required to perform\nthe activity. A force that is just enough to cause\na small cart to pick up a large velocity will\nproduce a negligible change in the motion of a\ntrain. This is because, in comparison to the\ncart the train has a much lesser tendency to\nchange its state of motion. Accordingly, we say\nthat the train has more inertia than the cart.\nClearly, heavier or more massive objects offer\nlarger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an\nobject is measured by its mass. We may thus\nrelate inertia and mass as follows:\nInertia is the natural tendency of an object to\nresist a change in its state of motion or of\nrest. The mass of an object is a measure of\nits inertia.\nuestions\n1.\nWhich of the following has more\ninertia: (a) a rubber ball and a\nstone of the same size? (b) a\nbicycle and a train?

Why?\nObserve that a groove is provided in a\nsaucer for placing the tea cup. It prevents\nthe cup from toppling over in case of\nsudden jerks.\n8.3 Inertia and Mass\nAll the examples and activities given so far\nillustrate that there is a resistance offered by\nan object to change its state of motion. If it is\nat rest it tends to remain at rest; if it is moving\nit tends to keep moving. This property of an\nobject is called its inertia. Do all bodies have\nthe same inertia? We know that it is easier to\npush an empty box than a box full of books.\nSimilarly, if we kick a football it flies away.\nBut if we kick a stone of the same size with\nequal force, it hardly moves. We may, in fact,\nget an injury in our foot while doing so!\nSimilarly, in activity 8.2, instead of a\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n\n\n\n\nits velocity changes, that is, the object gets an\nacceleration. We would now like to study how\nthe acceleration of an object depends on the\nforce applied to it and how we measure a force.\nLet us recount some observations from our\neveryday life. During the game of table tennis\nif the ball hits a player it does not hurt him.\nOn the other hand, when a fast moving cricket\nball hits a spectator, it may hurt him. A truck\nat rest does not require any attention when\nparked along a roadside. But a moving truck,\neven at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a\nperson standing in its path. A small mass,\nsuch as a bullet may kill a person when fired\nfrom a gun. These observations suggest that\nthe impact produced by the objects depends\non their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an\nobject is to be accelerated, we know that a\ngreater force is required to give a greater\nvelocity. In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object’s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton. The momentum, p of an object is\ndefined as the product of its mass, m and\nvelocity, v. That is,\np = mv\n(8.1)\nMomentum has both direction and\nmagnitude. Its direction is the same as that\nof velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is\nkilogram-metre per second (kg m s-1). Since\nthe application of an unbalanced force brings\na change in the velocity of the object, it is\ntherefore clear that a force also produces a\nchange of momentum.\nLet us consider a situation in which a car\nwith a dead battery is to be pushed along a\nstraight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which\nis sufficient to start its engine. If one or two\npersons give a sudden push (unbalanced force)\nto it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push\nover some time results in a gradual acceleration\nof the car to this speed. It means that the change\nof momentum of the car is not only determined\nby the magnitude of the force but also by the\ntime during which the force is exerted. It may\nthen also be concluded that the force necessary\nto change the momentum of an object depends\non the time rate at which the momentum is\nchanged.\nThe second law of motion states that the\nrate of change of momentum of an object is\nproportional to the applied unbalanced force\nin the direction of force.\n8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF\nSECOND LAW OF MOTION\nSuppose an object of mass, m is moving along\na straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is\nuniformly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t\nby the application of a constant force, F\nthroughout the time, t. The initial and final\nmomentum of the object will be, p1 = mu and\np2 = mv respectively.\nThe change in momentum\n∝p2 – p1\n∝mv – mu\n∝m × (v – u).\nThe rate of change of momentum ∝\n(\n)\n×\n−\nm\nv\nu\nt\nOr, the applied force,\nF ∝ \n(\n)\n×\n−\nm\nv\nu\nt\n(\n)\n×\n−\n= km\nv\nu\nt\nF\n(8.2)\n= k m a\n (8.3)\nHere a ∝ = [(v – u)/t] is the acceleration,\nwhich is the rate of change of velocity. The\nquantity, k is a constant of proportionality. The\nSI units of mass and acceleration are kg and\nm s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so\nchosen that the value of the constant, k\nbecomes one. For this, one unit of force is\ndefined as the amount that produces an\nacceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg mass.\nThat is,\n1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2).\nThus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3)\nF = ma\n(8.4)\nThe unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton,\nwhich has the symbol N. The second law of\nReprint 2025-26 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION\n\n\n\n\n\nmotion gives us a method to measure the force\nacting on an object as a product of its mass\nand acceleration.\nThe second law of motion is often seen in\naction in our everyday life. Have you noticed\nthat while catching a fast moving cricket ball,\na fielder in the ground gradually pulls his\nhands backwards with the moving ball? In\ndoing so, the fielder increases the time during\nwhich the high velocity of the moving ball\ndecreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of\nthe ball is decreased and therefore the impact\nof catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is\nalso reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly\nthen its high velocity decreases to zero in a\nvery short interval of time. Thus, the rate of\nchange of momentum of the ball will be large.\nTherefore, a large force would have to be\napplied for holding the catch that may hurt\nthe palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic\nevent, the athletes are made to fall either on\na cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to\nincrease the time of the athlete’s fall to stop\nafter making the jump. This decreases the rate\nof change of momentum and hence the force.\nTry to ponder how a karate player breaks a\nslab of ice with a single blow.\nThe first law of motion can be\nmathematically stated from the mathematical\nexpression for the second law of motion. Eq.\n(8.4) is\nF = ma\nor\nF\n(\n)\n−\n= m v\nu\nt\n(8.5)\nor\nFt = mv – mu\nThat is, when F = 0, v = u for whatever time,\nt is taken. This means that the object will\ncontinue moving with uniform velocity, u\nthroughout the time, t. If u is zero then v will\nalso be zero. That is, the object will remain\nat rest.\nExampl\nExampl\nExampl\nExampl\nExample 8.1\n8.1\n8.1\n8.1\n8.1 A constant force acts on an\nobject of mass 5 kg for a duration of\n2 s. It increases the object’s velocity\nfrom 3 m s–1 to 7 m s-1. Find the\nmagnitude of the applied force. Now, if\nthe force was applied for a duration of\n5 s, what would be the final velocity of\nthe object?\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\nWe have been given that u = 3 m s–1\nand v = 7 m s-1, t = 2 s and m = 5 kg.\nFrom Eq. (8.5) we have,\nF \n(\n)\n−\n= m v\nu\nt\nSubstitution of values in this relation\ngives\nF = 5 kg (7 m s-1 – 3 m s-1)/2 s = 10 N.\nNow, if this force is applied for a\nduration of 5 s (t = 5 s), then the final\nvelocity can be calculated by rewriting\nEq. (8.5) as\n=\n+ Ft\nv\nu\nm\nOn substituting the values of u, F, m and\nt, we get the final velocity,\nv = 13 m s-1.\nFig. 8.8:\nFig. 8.8:\nFig. 8.8:\nFig. 8.8:\nFig. 8.8: A fielder pulls his hands gradually with the\nmoving ball while holding a catch.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nExample 8.2 Which would require a\ngreater force –– accelerating a 2 kg mass\nat 5 m s–2 or a 4 kg mass at 2 m s-2 ?\nSolution:\nFrom Eq. (8.4), we have F = ma.\nHere we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2\nand m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2.\nThus, F1 = m1a1 = 2 kg × 5 m s-2 = 10 N;\nand F2 = m2a2 = 4 kg × 2 m s-2 = 8 N.\n⇒ F1 > F2.\nThus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at\n5 m s-2 would require a greater force.\nExample 8.3 A motorcar is moving with a\nvelocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to\nstop after the brakes are applied.\nCalculate the force exerted by the\nbrakes on the motorcar if its mass along\nwith the passengers is 1000 kg.\nSolution:\nThe initial velocity of the motorcar\nu = 108 km/h\n= 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s)\n= 30 m s-1\nand the final velocity of the motorcar\nv = 0 m s-1.\nThe total mass of the motorcar along\nwith its passengers = 1000 kg and the\ntime taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s.\nFrom Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude\nof the force (F) applied by the brakes as\nm(v – u)/t.\nOn substituting the values, we get\nF = 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s\n= – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N.\nThe negative sign tells us that the force\nexerted by the brakes is opposite to the\ndirection of motion of the motorcar.\nExample 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass\nm1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a\nmass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2.\nWhat acceleration would it give if both\nthe masses were tied together?\nSolution:\nFrom Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and\nm2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2;\na2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N.\nThus, m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and\nm2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg.\nIf the two masses were tied together,\nthe total mass, m would be\nm = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg.\nThe acceleration, a produced in the\ncombined mass by the 5 N force would\nbe, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.\nExample 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a\nball of mass 20 g moving along a\nstraight line on a long table is given in\nFig. 8.9.\nFig. 8.9\nHow much force does the table exert on\nthe ball to bring it to rest?\nSolution:\nThe initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1.\nDue to the frictional force exerted by the\ntable, the velocity of the ball decreases\ndown to zero in 10 s. Thus, u = 20 cm s–1;\nv = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the\nvelocity-time graph is a straight line, it is\nclear that the ball moves with a constant\nacceleration. The acceleration a is\n−\n= v\nu\na\nt\n= (0 cm s-1 – 20 cm s-1)/10 s\n= –2 cm s-2 = –0.02 m s-2.\nReprint 2025-26 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION\n\nThe force exerted on the ball F is,\nF = ma = (20/1000) kg × (– 0.02 m s-2)\n = – 0.0004 N.\nThe negative sign implies that the\nfrictional force exerted by the table is\nopposite to the direction of motion of\nthe ball.\n8.5 Third Law of Motion\nThe first two laws of motion tell us how an\napplied force changes the motion and provide\nus with a method of determining the force.\nThe third law of motion states that when one\nobject exerts a force on another object, the\nsecond object instantaneously exerts a force\nback on the first. These two forces are always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\nThese forces act on different objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a greater force,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a force\nto the other. In other words, there is a pair of\nforces and not just one force. The two\nopposing forces are also known as action and\nreaction forces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a force is applied\nthrough the free end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same readings on their scales. It means\nthat the force exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in direction\nto the force exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action and the other as reaction. This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. However, it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.\nFig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a road. You must\naccelerate, and this requires a force in\naccordance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this force? Is it the muscular effort\nyou exert on the road? Is it in the direction\nwe intend to move? No, you push the road\nbelow backwards. The road exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and reaction forces are always\nequal in magnitude, these forces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each force acts on a different\nobject that may have a different mass.\nWhen a gun is fired, it exerts a forward\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nFirst law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of\nrest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted\nupon by an unbalanced force.\n•\nThe natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their\nstate of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.\n•\nThe mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its SI unit\nis kilogram (kg).\n•\nForce of friction always opposes motion of objects.\n•\nSecond law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of\nan object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in\nthe direction of the force.\nActivity ______________ 8.4\n•\nRequest two children to stand on two\nseparate carts as shown in Fig. 8.13.\n•\nGive them a bag full of sand or some\nother heavy object. Ask them to play a\ngame of catch with the bag.\n•\nDoes each of them experience an\ninstantaneous force as a result of\nthrowing the sand bag?\n•\nYou can paint a white line on\ncartwheels to observe the motion of the\ntwo carts when the children throw the\nbag towards each other.\nFig. 8.12: As the sailor jumps in forward direction,\nthe boat moves backwards.\nFig. 8.13\nNow, place two children on one cart and\none on another cart. The second law of motion\ncan be seen, as this arrangement would show\ndifferent accelerations for the same force.\nThe cart shown in this activity can be\nconstructed by using a 12 mm or 18 mm thick\nplywood board of about 50 cm × 100 cm with\ntwo pairs of hard ball-bearing wheels (skate\nwheels are good to use). Skateboards are not\nas effective because it is difficult to maintain\nstraight-line motion.\nReprint 2025-26 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION\n\n•\nThe SI unit of force is kg m s–2. This is also known as newton\nand represented by the symbol N. A force of one newton\nproduces an acceleration of 1 m s–2 on an object of\nmass 1 kg.\n•\nThe momentum of an object is the product of its mass and\nvelocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity.\nIts SI unit is kg m s–1.\n•\nThird law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and\nopposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.\nExercises\n1.\nAn object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force.\nIs it possible for the object to be travelling with a non-zero\nvelocity?
