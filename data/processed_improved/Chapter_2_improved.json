But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure. For example, milk is actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins, etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particle. In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most of the matter around us exists as mixtures of two or more pure components, for example, sea water, minerals, soil, etc., are all mixtures. 2.1 What is a Mixture?",

        "Mixtures  are constituted by more than one kind of pure form of matter. We know that dissolved sodium chloride can be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself a pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. 2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES Depending upon the nature of the components that form a mixture, we can have different types of mixtures."

        "Fig. 2.2: Filtration Alloys: Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or a metal and a non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. But still, an alloy is considered as a mixture because it shows the properties of its constituents and can have variable composition. For example, brass is a mixture of approximately 30% zinc and 70% copper. IS MATTER AROUND US PURE? 15 Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 16 A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present in lesser quantity) is called the solute. Examples: (i) A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution. In this solution, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. (ii) A solution of iodine in alcohol known as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid) as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the solvent. (iii) Aerated drinks like soda water, etc., are gas in liquid solutions. These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent. (iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases. Its two main constituents are: oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The other gases are present in very small quantities. Properties of a Solution • A solution is a homogeneous mixture. • The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. • Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. So, the path of light is not visible in a solution. • The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a solution is stable. 2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION",
        "In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions. So, we understand that in a solution the relative proportion of the solute and solvent can be varied. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called  dilute, concentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms. In activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B."

        "• Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers. • Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring. • When no more solute can be dissolved, heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5oC.° • Start adding the solute again. Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride, that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature, the same? At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution. What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. We can infer from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature. The concentration of a solution is the amount (mass or volume) of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution. There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only three methods. (i) Mass by mass percentage of a solution Mass of solute = ×100 Mass of solution Reprint 2025-26 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE? 17 (ii) Mass by volume percentage of a solution Mass of solute = ×100 Volume of solution (iii) Volume by volume percentage of a solution Volume of solute = ×100 Volume of solution Example 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of common salt in 320 g of water. Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution. Solution:",
        "Mass of solute (salt) = 40 g Mass of solvent (water) = 320 g We know, Mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent = 40 g + 320 g = 360 g Mass percentage of solution Mass of solute = ×100 Massof solution 40 = ×100 =11.1% 360 2.2.2 WHAT IS A SUSPENSION? Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. Properties of a Suspension • Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture. • The particles of a suspension can be seen by the naked eye. • The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. • The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable. They can be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more. 2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION? The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution. Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect. Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air.",

        "• Colloids are big enough to scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. • They do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite stable. • They cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. But, a special technique of separation known as centrifugation can be used to separate the colloidal particles. The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium. Colloids are classified according to the state (solid, liquid or gas) of the dispersing medium and  the dispersed phase. A few common examples are given in Table 2.1. From this table you can see that they are very common everyday life. Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air. Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: The Tyndall effect"

        "In the previous chapter, we have learnt about a few physical properties of matter. The properties that can be observed and specified like colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity, density, melting point, boiling point etc. are the physical properites. The interconversion of states is a physical change because these changes occur without a change in composition and no change in the chemical nature of the substance. Although ice, water and water vapour all look different and display different physical properties, they are chemically the same. Both water and cooking oil  are liquid but their chemical characteristics are different. They differ in odour and inflammability. We know that oil burns in air whereas water extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property of oil that makes it different from water. Burning is a chemical change. During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical change brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. During burning of a candle, both physical and chemical changes take place. Can you distinguish these?"

        "On the basis of their chemical composition, substances can be classified either as elements or compounds. 2.4.1 ELEMENTS Robert Boyle was the first scientist to use the term element in 1661. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the first to establish an experimentally useful definition of an element. He defined an element as a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Elements can be normally divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals usually show some or all of the following properties: • They have a lustre (shine). • They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow colour. • They conduct heat and electricity. • They are ductile (can be drawn into wires). • They are malleable (can be hammered into thin sheets). • They are sonorous (make a ringing sound when hit). Examples of metals are gold, silver, copper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the following properties: • They display a variety of colours. • They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. • They are not lustrous, sonorous or malleable. Examples of non-metals are hydrogen, oxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine, Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 20 chlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate properties between those of metals and non- metals, they are  called metalloids; examples are boron, silicon, germanium, etc. More to  know 2.4.2 COMPOUNDS A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements, chemically combined with one another in a fixed proportion.

Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties.\nTherefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance.\n2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES\nDepending upon the nature of the components\nthat form a mixture, we can have different\ntypes of mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.1\n•\nLet us divide the class into groups A,\nB, C and D.\n•\nGroup A takes a beaker containing\n50 m L of water and one spatula full\nof copper sulphate powder. Group B\ntakes 50 m L of water and two spatula\nfull of copper sulphate powder in a\nbeaker.\n•\nGroups C and D can take different\namounts of copper sulphate and\npotassium permanganate or common\nsalt (sodium chloride) and mix the\ngiven components to form a mixture.\n•\nReport the observations on the\nuniformity in colour and texture.\n•\nGroups A and B have obtained a\nmixture which has a uniform\ncomposition \nthroughout. \nSuch\nmixtures are called homogeneous\nmixtures or solutions. Some other\nexamples of such mixtures are: (i) salt\ndissolved in water and (ii) sugar\ndissolved in water.

Though both the groups have\nobtained copper sulphate solution but\nthe intensity of colour of the solutions\nis different. This shows that a\nhomogeneous mixture can have a\nvariable composition.\n•\nGroups C and D have obtained\nmixtures, which contain physically\ndistinct parts and have non-uniform\ncompositions. Such mixtures are called\nheterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of\nsodium chloride and iron filings, salt\nand sulphur, and oil and water are\nexamples of heterogeneous mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.2\n•\nLet us again divide the class into four\ngroups— A, B, C and D.\n•\nDistribute the following samples to\neach group:\n−\nFew crystals of copper sulphate\nto group A.\n−\nOne spatula full of copper\nsulphate to group B.\n−\nChalk powder or wheat flour to\ngroup C.\n−\nFew drops of milk or ink to\ngroup D.\n•\nEach group should add the given\nsample in water and stir properly\nusing a glass rod. Are the particles\nin the mixture visible?\n•\nDirect a beam of light from a torch\nthrough the beaker containing the\nmixture and observe from the front. Was\nthe path of the beam of light visible?\n•\nLeave the mixtures undisturbed for\na few minutes (and set up the\nfiltration apparatus in the meantime).\nIs the mixture stable or do the\nparticles begin to settle after some\ntime?\n•\nFilter the mixture. Is there any\nresidue on the filter paper?\n•\nDiscuss the results and form an\nopinion.\nGroups A and B have got a solution.\nGroup C has got a suspension.\nGroup D has got a colloidal solution.\nNow, we shall learn about solutions,\nsuspensions and colloidal solutions in the\nfollowing sections.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat is meant by a substance?\n2.\nList the points of differences\nbetween homogeneous and\nheterogeneous mixtures.\n2.2 What is a Solution?\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two\nor more substances. You come across various\ntypes of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,\nsoda water, etc., are all examples of solutions.\nUsually we think of a solution as a liquid that\ncontains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved\nin it. But, we can also have solid solutions\n(alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a\nsolution there is homogeneity at the particle\nlevel. For example, lemonade tastes the same\nthroughout. This shows that particles of sugar\nor \nsalt \nare \nevenly \ndistributed \nin\nthe solution.\nQ\nFig. 2.2: Filtration\nAlloys: Alloys are mixtures of two or\nmore metals or a metal and a non-metal\nand cannot be separated into their\ncomponents by physical methods. But\nstill, an alloy is considered as a mixture\nbecause it shows the properties of its\nconstituents and can have variable\ncomposition. For example, brass is a\nmixture of approximately 30% zinc and\n70% copper.\nIS MATTER AROUND US PURE?\n\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nA solution has a solvent and a solute as its\ncomponents. The component of the solution\nthat dissolves the other component in it\n(usually the component present in larger\namount) is called the solvent. The component\nof the solution that is dissolved in the solvent\n(usually present in lesser quantity) is called\nthe solute.\nExamples:\n(i)\nA solution of sugar in water is a solid\nin liquid solution. In this solution,\nsugar is the solute and water is\nthe solvent.\n(ii)\nA solution of iodine in alcohol known\nas ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid)\nas the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the\nsolvent.\n(iii)\nAerated drinks like soda water, etc., are\ngas in liquid solutions. These contain\ncarbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water\n(liquid) as solvent.\n(iv)\nAir is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a\nhomogeneous mixture of a number of\ngases. Its two main constituents are:\noxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The\nother gases are present in very\nsmall quantities.\nProperties of a Solution\n•\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture.\n•\nThe particles of a solution are smaller\nthan 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes.\n•\nBecause of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution.\n•\nThe solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed, that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relative\nproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called dilute,\nconcentrated or saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n•\nTake approximately 50 m L of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n•\nAdd salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n•\nWhen no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5o C.°\n•\nStart adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer from the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume) of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution.\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)\nMass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute\n=\n×100\nMass of solution\nReprint 2025-26 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?\n\n(ii)\nMass by volume percentage of a solution\nMass of solute\n=\n×100\nVolume of solution\n(iii)\nVolume by volume percentage of a\nsolution\nVolume of solute\n=\n×100\nVolume of solution\nExample 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of\ncommon salt in 320 g of water. Calculate\nthe concentration in terms of mass by\nmass percentage of the solution.\nSolution:\nMass of solute (salt)\n=\n40 g\nMass of solvent (water) =\n320 g\nWe know,\nMass of solution = Mass of solute +\nMass of solvent\n= 40 g + 320 g\n= 360 g\nMass percentage of solution\nMass of solute\n=\n×100\nMassof solution\n \n\n=\n×100 =11.1%\n\n2.2.2 WHAT IS A SUSPENSION?\nNon-homogeneous systems, like those\nobtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which\nsolids are dispersed in liquids, are called\nsuspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture in which the solute particles do not\ndissolve but remain suspended throughout\nthe bulk of the medium. Particles of a\nsuspension are visible to the naked eye.\nProperties of a Suspension\n•\nSuspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture.\n•\nThe particles of a suspension can be seen\nby the naked eye.\n•\nThe particles of a suspension scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•\nThe solute particles settle down when a\nsuspension is left undisturbed, that is,\na suspension is unstable. They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.\nBecause of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.\nBut, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air.\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.\n(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n•\nColloids are big enough to scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•\nThey do not settle down when left\nundisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite\nstable.\n•\nThey cannot be separated from the\nmixture by the process of filtration. But,\na special technique of separation known\nas centrifugation can be used to\nseparate the colloidal particles.\nThe components of a colloidal solution are\nthe dispersed phase and the dispersion\nmedium. The solute-like component or the\ndispersed particles in a colloid form the\ndispersed phase, and the component in which\nthe dispersed phase is suspended is known\nas the dispersing medium. Colloids are\nclassified according to the state (solid, liquid\nor gas) of the dispersing medium and the\ndispersed phase. A few common examples are\ngiven in Table 2.1. From this table you can\nsee that they are very common everyday life.\nTyndall effect can be observed when\nsunlight passes through the canopy of a dense\nforest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets\nof water, which act as particles of colloid\ndispersed in air.\nFig. 2.4:\nFig. 2.4:\nFig. 2.4:\nFig. 2.4:\nFig. 2.4: The Tyndall effect\nuestions\n1.\nDifferentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples.\n2.\nHow are sol, solution and suspension different from each other?\n3.\nTo make a saturated solution, 36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water\nat 293 K.

The\nproperties that can be observed and specified\nlike colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity,\ndensity, melting point, boiling point etc. are\nthe physical properites.\nThe interconversion of states is a physical\nchange because these changes occur without\na change in composition and no change in the\nchemical nature of the substance. Although\nice, water and water vapour all look different\nand display different physical properties, they\nare chemically the same.\nBoth water and cooking oil are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different.\nThey differ in odour and inflammability. We\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it different from water.\nBurning is a chemical change. During this\nprocess one substance reacts with another to\nundergo a change in chemical composition.\nChemical change brings change in the\nchemical properties of matter and we get new\nsubstances. A chemical change is also called\na chemical reaction.\nDuring burning of a candle, both physical\nand chemical changes take place. Can you\ndistinguish these?\nuestions\n1.\nClassify the following as chemical\nor physical changes:\n•\ncutting of trees,\n•\nmelting of butter in a pan,\n•\nrusting of almirah,\n•\nboiling of water to form steam,\n•\npassing of electric current,\nthrough water and the water\nbreaking down into hydrogen\nand oxygen gases,\n•\ndissolving common salt in\nwater,\n•\nmaking a fruit salad with raw\nfruits, and\nQ\n•\nburning of paper and wood.\n2.\nTry segregating the things\naround you as pure substances\nor mixtures.\n2.4 What are the Types of Pure\nSubstances?\nOn the basis of their chemical composition,\nsubstances can be classified either as elements\nor compounds.\n2.4.1 ELEMENTS\nRobert Boyle was the first scientist to use the\nterm element in 1661. Antoine Laurent\nLavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the\nfirst to establish an experimentally useful\ndefinition of an element. He defined an element\nas a basic form of matter that cannot be broken\ndown into simpler substances by chemical\nreactions.\nElements can be normally divided into\nmetals, non-metals and metalloids.\nMetals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•\nThey have a lustre (shine).\n•\nThey have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour.\n•\nThey conduct heat and electricity.\n•\nThey are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires).\n•\nThey are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets).\n•\nThey are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit).\nExamples of metals are gold, silver,\ncopper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature.\nNon-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•\nThey display a variety of colours.\n•\nThey are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity.\n•\nThey are not lustrous, sonorous\nor malleable.\nExamples of non-metals are hydrogen,\noxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine,\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nchlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate\nproperties between those of metals and non-\nmetals, they are called metalloids; examples\nare boron, silicon, germanium, etc.\nMore to know\n2.4.2 COMPOUNDS\nA compound is a substance composed of two\nor more elements, chemically combined with\none another in a fixed proportion.\nWhat do we get when two or more elements\nare combined?\nActivity ______________ 2.4\n•\nDivide the class into two groups.

Did the gas in\nboth the cases smell the same\nor different?\nThe gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen,\nit is colourless, odourless and combustible– it\nis not advised to do the combustion test for\nhydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by\nGroup II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless\ngas with the smell of rotten eggs.\nYou must have observed that the products\nobtained by both the groups show different\nproperties, though the starting materials were\nthe same. Group I has carried out the activity\ninvolving a physical change whereas in case\nof Group II, a chemical change (a chemical\nreaction) has taken place.\n•\nThe material obtained by group I is a\nmixture of the two substances.

Ninety-two elements\nare naturally occurring and the\nrest are man-made.\n•\nMajority of the elements are\nsolid.\n•\nEleven elements are in gaseous\nstate at room temperature.\n•\nTwo elements are liquid at\nroom temperature—mercury\nand bromine.\n•\nElements, gallium and cesium\nbecome liquid at a temperature\nslightly \nabove \nroom\ntemperature (303 K).\nReprint 2025-26 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?\n\n•\nThe material obtained by group II is a\ncompound.\n•\nOn heating the two elements strongly we\nget a compound, which has totally\ndifferent properties compared to the\ncombining elements.\n•\nThe composition of a compound is the\nsame throughout. We can also observe\nthat the texture and the colour of the\ncompound are the same throughout.\nThus, we can summarise the physical\nand chemical nature of matter in the\nfollowing graphical organiser:\nTable 2.2: Mixtures and Compounds\nMixtures\nCompounds\n1.
