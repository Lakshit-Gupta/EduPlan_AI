        "Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same structure? Do they both perform similar functions?",
        "There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. They consume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life. These tissues are localised in certain regions. Based on the dividing capacity of the tissues, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is more uniform. So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and non- dividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants. This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in their different feeding methods. Also, they are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design. It is with reference to these complex animal and plant bodies that we will now talk about the concept of tissues in some detail."

        "The growth of plants occurs only in certain specific regions. This is because the dividing tissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is located only at these points. Depending on the region where they are present, meristematic tissues are classified as apical, lateral and intercalary (Fig. 6.2). New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as they grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of other tissues.",

In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to help them float. Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. The flexibility in plants is due to another permanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows bending of various parts of a plant like tendrils and stems of climbers without breaking. It also provides mechanical support. We can find this tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis. The cells of this tissue are living, elongated and  irregularly  thickened  at  the corners.

Since it has a protective role to play, cells of epidermal  tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration (loss of water in the form of water  vapour)  also  takes  place through stomata.",

In some plants like desert plants, epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin (chemical substance with waterproof quality) on its outer surface. Can we think of a reason for this? Is the outer layer of a branch of a tree different from the outer layer of a young stem? As plants grow older, the outer protective tissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of secondary meristem located in the cortex forms layers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells of cork are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6).

Tracheids and vessels have thick walls, and many are dead cells when mature. Tracheids and vessels are tubular structures. This allows them to transport water and minerals vertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem fibres are mainly supportive in function. Phloem is made up of five types of cells: sieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma [Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with perforated walls. Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant. Except phloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells.",

The functions of mitochondria we studied earlier provide a clue to this question. Blood flows and carries various substances from one part of the body to the other. For example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells. It also collects wastes from all parts of the body and carries them to the liver and kidney for disposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of  the functions they perform we can think of different types of animal tissues, such as epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective tissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.",
        "6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE",
        "The covering or protective tissues in the animal body are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers most organs and cavities within the body. It also forms a barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed and form a continuous sheet. They have only a small amount of cementing material between them and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the body must cross at least one layer of epithelium. As a result, the permeability of the cells of various epithelia play an important role in regulating the exchange of materials between the body and the external environment and also between different parts of the body. Regardless of the type, all epithelium is usually separated from the underlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous basement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing structures that correlate with their unique functions. For example, in cells lining blood vessels or lung alveoli, where transportation of substances occurs through a selectively permeable surface, there is a simple flat kind",

        "of skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to prevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged in a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as in the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial cells are present. This columnar (meaning ‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory tract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia, which are hair-like projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can move, and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides mechanical support. Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells, which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium.",

Now, let us look at this type of tissue in some more detail. The cells of connective tissue are loosely spaced and embedded in an intercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature of matrix differs in concordance with the function of the particular connective tissue."

        "Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called plasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets are suspended. The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones and waste materials to different parts of the body. Bone is another example of a connective tissue. It forms the framework that supports the body. It also anchors the muscles and supports the main organs of the body. It is a strong and nonflexible tissue (what would be the advantage of these properties for bone functions?). Bone cells are embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable strength. Ligaments contain very little matrix and connect bones with bones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility. Another type of connective tissue, cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid matrix is composed of proteins and sugars. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our arms. Think of how  the two tissues are different! Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, around blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills the space inside the organs, supports internal organs and helps in repair of tissues. Where are fats stored in our body? Fat- storing adipose tissue is found below the skin and between internal organs. The cells of this tissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator.",

  "full_text": "From the last chapter, we recall that all living\norganisms are made of cells. In unicellular\norganisms, a single cell performs all basic\nfunctions. For example, in Amoeba, a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour. Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue.\n6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues?\nLet us compare their structure and functions.\nDo plants and animals have the same\nstructure? Do they both perform similar\nfunctions?\nThere are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they\ndon’t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\nAnimals on the other hand move around\nin search of food, mates and shelter. They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\nAnother difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals.\nThe structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\nthese two major groups of organisms,\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\ndesign.\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.\n\nTISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 Lateral meristem\nuestions\n1.\nWhat is a tissue?\n2.\nWhat is the utility of tissues in\nmulti-cellular organisms?\n6.2 Plant Tissues\n6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE\n•\nFrom the above observations, answer\nthe following questions:\n1. Which of the two onions has longer\nroots? Why?\n2. Do the roots continue growing\neven after we have removed their\ntips?\n3. Why would the tips stop growing\nin jar 2 after we cut them?\nThe growth of plants occurs only in certain\nspecific regions. This is because the dividing\ntissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is\nlocated only at these points. Depending on\nthe region where they are present,\nmeristematic tissues are classified as apical,\nlateral and intercalary (Fig. 6.2). New cells\nproduced by meristem are initially like those\nof meristem itself, but as they grow and\nmature, their characteristics slowly change and\nthey become differentiated as components of\nother tissues.\nFig. 6.1: Growth of roots in onion bulbs\nActivity ______________ 6.1\n•\nTake two glass jars and fill them with\nwater.\n•\nNow, take two onion bulbs and place\none on each jar, as shown in\nFig. 6.1.\n•\nObserve the growth of roots in both\nthe bulbs for a few days.\n•\nMeasure the length of roots on day 1,\n2 and 3.\n•\nOn day 4, cut the root tips of the onion\nbulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm. After this,\nobserve the growth of roots in both the\njars and measure their lengths each\nday for five more days and record the\nobservations in tables, like the table\nbelow:\nLength\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nDay 4\nDay 5\nJar 1\nJar 2\nQ\nApical meristem is present at the growing\ntips of stems and roots and increases the\nlength of the stem and the root. The girth of\nthe stem or root increases due to lateral\nmeristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem\nseen in some plants is located near the node.\nFig. 6.2: Location of meristematic tissue in plant body\nJar 1\nJar 2\nTISSUES\n\nApical meristem\nIntercalary meristem\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nCuticle\nEpidermis\nCollenchyma\nParenchyma\nPhloem\nVascular bundle\nXylem\nFig. 6.3: Section of a stem\nCells of meristematic tissue are very active,\nthey have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls\nand prominent nuclei. They lack vacuoles. Can\nwe think why they would lack vacuoles? (You\nmight want to refer to the functions of vacuoles\nin the chapter on cells.)\n6.2.2 PERMANENT TISSUE\nWhat happens to the cells formed by\nmeristematic tissue? They take up a specific\nrole and lose the ability to divide. As a result,\nthey form a permanent tissue. This process\nof taking up a permanent shape, size, and a\nfunction is called differentiation. Differentiation\nleads to the development of various types of\npermanent tissues.\n3.\nCan we think of reasons why there\nwould be so many types of cells?\n•\nWe can also try to cut sections of plant\nroots. We can even try cutting sections\nof root and stem of different plants.\n6.2.2 (i) SIMPLE PERMANENT TISSUE\nA few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are\ngenerally simple permanent tissue.\nParenchyma is the most common simple\npermanent tissue. It consists of relatively\nunspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They\nare living cells. They are usually loosely\narranged, thus large spaces between cells\n(intercellular spaces) are found in this tissue\n(Fig. 6.4 a). This tissue generally stores food.\nActivity ______________ 6.2\n•\nTake a plant stem and with the help\nof your teacher cut into very thin slices\nor sections.\n•\nNow, stain the slices with safranin.\nPlace one neatly cut section on a slide,\nand put a drop of glycerine.\n•\nCover with a cover-slip and observe\nunder a microscope. Observe the\nvarious types of cells and their\narrangement. Compare it with Fig. 6.3.\n•\nNow, answer the following on the\nbasis of your observation:\n1.\nAre all cells similar in structure?\n2.\nHow many types of cells can\nbe seen?\nIn some situations, it contains chlorophyll and\nperforms photosynthesis, and then it is called\nchlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air\ncavities are present in parenchyma to help\nthem float. Such a parenchyma type is called\naerenchyma.\nThe flexibility in plants is due to another\npermanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows\nbending of various parts of a plant like tendrils\nand stems of climbers without breaking. It\nalso provides mechanical support. We can find\nthis tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.\nThe cells of this tissue are living, elongated\nand \nirregularly \nthickened \nat \nthe\ncorners. There is very little intercellular space\n(Fig. 6.4 b).\nReprint 2025-26 TISSUES\n\nFig. 6.4: Various types of simple tissues: (a) Parenchyma (b) Collenchyma (c) Sclerenchyma (i) transverse section,\n(ii) longitudinal section.\nYet another type of permanent tissue is\nsclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes the\nplant hard and stiff. We have seen the husk of\na coconut. It is made of sclerenchymatous\ntissue. The cells of this tissue are dead. They\nare long and narrow as the walls are thickened\ndue to lignin. Often these walls are so thick\nthat there is no internal space inside the cell\n(Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems,\naround vascular bundles, in the veins of leaves\nand in the hard covering of seeds and nuts. It\nprovides strength to the plant parts.\nActivity ______________ 6.3\n•\nTake a freshly plucked leaf of Rhoeo.\n•\nStretch and break it by applying\npressure.\n•\nWhile breaking it, keep it stretched\ngently so that some peel or skin\nprojects out from the cut.\n•\nRemove this peel and put it in a petri\ndish filled with water.\n•\nAdd a few drops of safranin.\n•\nWait for a couple of minutes and then\ntransfer it onto a slide. Gently place\na cover slip over it.\n•\nObserve under microscope.\nWhat you observe is the outermost layer\nof cells, called epidermis. The epidermis is\nusually made of a single layer of cells. In some\nplants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis\nmay be thicker since protection against water\nloss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has\nan outer covering epidermis. It protects all the\nparts of the plant. Epidermal cells on the aerial\na\nIntercellular spaces\nb\nWall thickenings\nNucleus\nVacuole\nCell wall\nNarrow lumen\nLignified\nthick wall\nc (ii)\nc (i)\nThick lignified\nwalls\nFig. 6.5: Guard cells and epidermal cells: (a) lateral\nview, (b) surface view\n(a)\n(b)\nGuard\ncell\nStoma\nEpidermal\ncell\nGuard\ncells\nparts of the plant often secrete a waxy, water-\nresistant layer on their outer surface. This aids\nin protection against loss of water, mechanical\ninjury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since\nit has a protective role to play, cells of\nepidermal tissue form a continuous layer\nwithout intercellular spaces. Most epidermal\ncells are relatively flat. Often their outer and\nside walls are thicker than the inner wall.\nWe can observe small pores here and\nthere in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores\nare called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are\nenclosed by two kidney-shaped cells\ncalled guard cells. They are necessary for\nexchanging gases with the atmosphere.\nTranspiration (loss of water in the form of\nwater \nvapour) \nalso \ntakes \nplace\nthrough stomata.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nRecall which gas is required for\nphotosynthesis.\nFind out the role of transpiration in plants.\nEpidermal cells of the roots, whose function\nis water absorption, commonly bear long hair-\nlike parts that greatly increase the total\nabsorptive surface area.\nIn some plants like desert plants,\nepidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin\n(chemical substance with waterproof quality)\non its outer surface. Can we think of a reason\nfor this?\nIs the outer layer of a branch of a tree\ndifferent from the outer layer of a young stem?\nAs plants grow older, the outer protective\ntissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of\nsecondary meristem located in the cortex forms\nlayers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells\nof cork are dead and compactly arranged\nwithout intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They\nalso have a substance called suberin in their\nwalls that makes them impervious to gases\nand water.\nis a distinctive feature of the complex plants,\none that has made possible their survival in\nthe terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing\na section of stem, can you see different types\nof cells in the vascular bundle?\nXylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem\nparenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres.\nTracheids and vessels have thick walls, and\nmany are dead cells when mature. Tracheids\nand vessels are tubular structures. This allows\nthem to transport water and minerals\nvertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem\nfibres are mainly supportive in function.\nPhloem is made up of five types of cells:\nsieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells,\nphloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma\n[Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with\nperforated walls. Phloem transports food from\nleaves to other parts of the plant. Except\nphloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells.\n6.2.2 (ii) COMPLEX PERMANENT TISSUE\nThe different types of tissues we have discussed\nuntil now are all made of one type of cells,\nwhich look like each other. Such tissues are\ncalled simple permanent tissue. Yet another\ntype of permanent tissue is complex tissue.\nComplex tissues are made of more than one\ntype of cells. All these cells coordinate to\nperform a common function. Xylem and\nphloem are examples of such complex tissues.\nThey are both conducting tissues and\nconstitute a vascular bundle.

How do these body\nparts move? For this we have specialised cells\ncalled muscle cells (Fig. 6.8). The contraction\nand relaxation of these cells result\nin movement.\nQ\nFig. 6.8: Location of muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibre\n(Cell)\nNucleus\nDuring breathing we inhale oxygen. Where\ndoes this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs\nand then is transported to all the body cells\nthrough blood. Why would cells need oxygen?\nThe functions of mitochondria we studied\nearlier provide a clue to this question. Blood\nflows and carries various substances from one\npart of the body to the other. For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal.\nBlood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.\n6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces.\nObviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body. Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane.\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nFig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissues\nof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium.\nWhere absorption and secretion occur, as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which are hair-like projections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium.\nCuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium.\n6.3.2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue. Why would\nit be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue is\nprovided in the introduction of this chapter!\nNow, let us look at this type of tissue in some\nmore detail. The cells of connective tissue are\nloosely spaced and embedded in an\nintercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may\nbe jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature\nof matrix differs in concordance with the\nfunction of the particular connective tissue.\nActivity 6.4\nTake a drop of blood on a slide and\nobserve different cells present in it\nunder a microscope.\nof epithelium. This is called the simple\nsquamous epithelium (squama means scale\n(a) Squamous\n(b) Stratified squamous\n(c) Cuboidal\n(d) Columnar (Ciliated)\nReprint 2025-26 TISSUES\n\nBlood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called\nplasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs),\nwhite blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets\nare suspended. The plasma contains proteins,\nsalts and hormones. Blood flows and\ntransports gases, digested food, hormones\nand waste materials to different parts of\nthe body.\nBone is another example of a connective\ntissue. It forms the framework that supports\nthe body. It also anchors the muscles and\nsupports the main organs of the body. It is a\nstrong and nonflexible tissue (what would be\nthe advantage of these properties for bone\nfunctions?). Bone cells are embedded in a\nhard matrix that is composed of calcium and\nphosphorus compounds.\nTwo bones can be connected to each other\nby another type of connective tissue called the\nligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has\nconsiderable strength. Ligaments contain\nvery little matrix and connect bones with\nbones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and\nare another type of connective tissue. Tendons\nare fibrous tissue with great strength but\nlimited flexibility.\nAnother type of connective tissue,\ncartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid\nmatrix is composed of proteins and sugars.\nCartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints\nand is also present in the nose, ear, trachea\nand larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears,\nbut we cannot bend the bones in our arms.\nThink of how the two tissues are different!\nAreolar connective tissue is found between\nthe skin and muscles, around blood vessels\nand nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills\nthe space inside the organs, supports internal\norgans and helps in repair of tissues.\nWhere are fats stored in our body? Fat-\nstoring adipose tissue is found below the skin\nand between internal organs. The cells of this\ntissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of\nfats also lets it act as an insulator.\n6.3.3 MUSCULAR TISSUE\nMuscular tissue consists of elongated cells,\nalso called muscle fibres. This tissue is\nresponsible for movement in our body.\nFig. 6.10: Types of connective tissues: (a) types of blood\ncells, (b) compact bone, (c) hyaline cartilage,\n(d) areolar tissue, (e) adipose tissue\n(a)\nDifferent white\nblood corpuscles\nNeutrophil\n(polynuclear\nleucocyte)\nBasophil\nEosinophil\nNucleus\nCytoplasm\nLymphocyte\nMonocyte\nPlatelets\nHaversian canal\n(contains blood vessels\nand nerve fibres)\nCanaliculus (contains\nslender process of bone\ncell or osteocyte)\nHyaline matrix\nChondrocyte\nRed blood\ncorpuscle\n(b)\n(c)\nReticular fibre\nFibroblast\nMacrophage\nCollagen fibre\nMast cell\nPlasma cell\n(d)\nFat droplet\nNucleus\nAdipocyte\n(e)\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n[Fig. 6.11(a)]. These muscles are also called\nskeletal muscles as they are mostly attached\nto bones and help in body movement. Under\nthe microscope, these muscles show alternate\nlight and dark bands or striations when\nstained appropriately. As a result, they are\nalso called striated muscles. The cells of this\ntissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and\nmultinucleate (having many nuclei).\nThe movement of food in the alimentary\ncanal or the contraction and relaxation of blood\nvessels are involuntary movements. We cannot\nreally start them or stop them simply by\nwanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig.\n6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles control such\nmovements. They are also found in the iris of\nthe eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the\nlungs. The cells are long with pointed ends\n(spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a\nsingle nucleus). They are also called unstriated\nmuscles – why would they be called that?\nThe muscles of the heart show rhythmic\ncontraction and relaxation throughout life.\nThese involuntary muscles are called cardiac\nmuscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are\ncylindrical, branched and uninucleate.\nActivity 6.5\nCompare the structures of different\ntypes of muscular tissues. Note down\ntheir shape, number of nuclei and\nposition of nuclei within the cell in\nthe Table 6.1.\nTable 6.1:\nFeatures\nStriated\nSmooth\nCardiac\nShape\nNumber of nuclei\nPosition of nuclei\n6.3.4 NERVOUS TISSUE\nAll cells possess the ability to respond to\nstimuli. However, cells of the nervous tissue\nare highly specialised for being stimulated and\nMuscles contain special proteins called\ncontractile proteins, which contract and relax\nto cause movement.\nFig. 6.11: Types of muscles fibres: (a) striated muscle,\n(b) smooth muscle, (c) cardiac muscle\nWe can move some muscles by conscious\nwill.

Many nerve fibres bound together by\nconnective tissue make up a nerve.\nThe signal that passes along the nerve fibre\nis called a nerve impulse. The nerve impulse\nfrom the nerve endings in transmitted to the\ndendrites of the next nerve cell. Nerve\nimpulses allow us to move our muscles when\nwe want to. The functional combination of\nnerve and muscle tissue is fundamental to\nmost animals. This combination enables\nanimals to move rapidly in response to stimuli.\nuestions\n1.\nName the tissue responsible for\nmovement in our body.\n2.\nWhat does a neuron look like?\n3.\nGive three features of cardiac\nmuscles.\n4.\nWhat are the functions of areolar\ntissue?\nQ\nNucleus\nDendrite\nAxon\nNerve ending\nCell body\nFig. 6.12:\nFig. 6.12:\nFig. 6.12:\nFig. 6.12:\nFig. 6.12: Neuron—a unit of nervous tissue\nthen transmitting the stimulus very rapidly\nfrom one place to another within the body.
