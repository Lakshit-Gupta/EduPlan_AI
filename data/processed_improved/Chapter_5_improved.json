        "• Let us take a small piece from an onion bulb. With the help of a pair of forceps, we can peel off the skin (called epidermis) from the concave side (inner layer) of the onion. This layer can be put immediately in a watch-glass containing water. This will prevent the peel from getting folded or getting dry. What do we do with this peel? • Let us take a glass slide, put a drop of water on it and transfer a small piece of the peel from the watch glass to the slide. Make sure that the peel is perfectly flat on the slide. A thin camel hair paintbrush might be necessary to help transfer the peel. Now we put a drop of safranin solution on this piece followed by a cover slip. Take care to avoid air bubbles while putting the cover slip with the help of a mounting needle. Ask your teacher for help. We have prepared a temporary mount of onion peel. We can observe this slide under low power followed by high powers of a compound microscope.

        "• We can try preparing temporary mounts of leaf peels, tip of roots of onion or even peels of onions of different sizes. • After performing the above activity, let us see what the answers to the following questions would be: (a) Do all cells look alike in terms of shape and size? (b) Do all cells look alike in structure? (c) Could we find differences among cells from different parts of a plant body? (d) What similarities could we find? Some organisms can also have cells of different kinds. Look at the following picture. It depicts some cells from the human body. Sperm Bone cell Smooth muscle cell Blood cells Ovum Fig. 5.3: Various cells from the human body More to  know We can try preparing temporary mounts of peels of onions of different sizes. What do we observe? Do we see similar structures or different structures? What are these structures? These structures look similar to each other. Together they form a big structure like an onion bulb! We find from this activity that onion bulbs of different sizes have similar small structures visible under a microscope. The cells of the onion peel will all look the same, regardless of the size of the onion they came from. These small structures that we see are the basic building units of the onion bulb. These structures are called cells. Not only onions, but all organisms that we observe around are made up of cells. However, there are also single cells that live on their own.",
        "Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke  in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of  a  primitive  microscope. Leeuwenhoek (1674), with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time.  It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell.  Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid substance of the cell. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, Schleiden (1838) and  Schwann (1839). The cell theory was further expanded by Virchow (1855) by suggesting that all cells arise  from pre-existing cells.  With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and its various organelles. The invention of magnifying lenses led to the discovery of the microscopic world. It is now known that a single cell may constitute a whole organism as in Amoeba, Nerve Cell Fat cell Reprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 51",
        "The shape and size of cells are related to the specific function they perform. Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes. In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape. Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic of all living forms. How does a living cell perform these basic functions? We know that there is a division of labour in multicellular organisms such as human beings. This means that different parts of the human body perform different functions. The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material from the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles. These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell. It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organelles, no matter what their function is or what organism they are found in."

        "We saw above that the cell has special components called organelles. How is a cell organised? If we study a cell under a microscope, we would come across three features in almost every cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and interactions of the cell with its environment are possible due to these features. Let us see how. 5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL MEMBRANE",
        "This is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane. How does the movement of substances take place into the cell? How do substances move out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. We have studied the process of diffusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis."

        "Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 52 52 52 52 52 The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following three things could happen: 1. If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3. If  the  medium  has  a  lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity:"

Put the egg in pure water and observe after 5 minutes. What do we observe? The egg swells because water passes into it by osmosis. (b) Place a similar de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution into the salt solution because the salt solution is more concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried raisins or apricots."

        "• Put dried raisins or apricots in plain water and leave them for some time. Then place them into a concentrated solution of sugar or salt. You will observe the following: (a) Each gains water and swells when placed in water. (b) However, when placed in the concentrated solution it loses water, and consequently shrinks. Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition from its environment. Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane only through an electron microscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes. Reprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 53"

Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane? 5.2.2 CELL WALL Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis. We can observe this phenomenon by performing the following activity:"

        "• Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water on a slide and examine cells under the high power of a microscope. Note the small green granules, called chloroplasts. They contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a minute and observe under a microscope. What do we see? • Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling water for a few minutes. This kills the cells. Then mount one leaf on a slide and observe it under a microscope. Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a minute and observe it again. What do we find? Did plasmolysis occur now? What do we infer from this activity? It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells. 5.2.3 NUCLEUS Remember the temporary mount of onion peel we prepared? We had put iodine solution on the peel. Why? What would we see if we tried observing the peel without putting the iodine solution? Try it and see what the difference is. Further, when we put iodine solution on the peel, did each cell get evenly coloured? According to their chemical composition different regions of cells get coloured differentially. Some regions appear darker than other regions. Apart from iodine solution we could also use safranin solution or methylene blue solution to stain the cells. We have observed cells from an onion; let us now observe cells from our own body."

        "Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 54 • Was there a darkly coloured, spherical or oval, dot-like structure near the centre of each cell? This structure is called nucleus. Were there similar structures in onion peel cells? The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we will talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles",
        "present in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlorophyll in photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is associated with membranous vesicles (bag like structures) but not with plastids as in eukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5). Ribosomes Plasma membrane Cell wall Nucleoid Fig. 5.4: Prokaryotic cell 5.2.4 CYTOPLASM When we look at the temporary mounts of onion peel as well as human cheek cells, we can see a large region of each cell enclosed by the cell membrane. This region takes up very little stain. It is called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane. It also contains many specialised cell organelles. Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell. Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. In prokaryotes, beside the absence of a defined nuclear region, the membrane-bound cell organelles are also absent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membrane-enclosed organelles. The significance of membranes can be illustrated with the example of viruses. Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until they enter a living body and use its cell machinery to multiply. Reprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 55"

Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, these cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a previous section. Some important examples of cell organelles which we will discuss now are: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells. 5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)",
        "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This process is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system."

The ER also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 56 Camillo Golgi was born at Corteno near Brescia in 1843.  He  studied medicine at the University of Pavia. After graduating in 1865, he continued to work in Pavia at the Hospital of St. Matteo. At that time most of his investigations  were concerned with the nervous system, In 1872 he accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer at the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at Abbiategrasso.  He first started his investigations into the nervous system in a little kitchen of this hospital, which he had converted into a laboratory. However, the work of greatest importance, which Golgi carried out was a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures. This method is referred to as the ‘black reaction’. This method uses a weak solution of silver nitrate and is particularly valuable in tracing the processes and most delicate ramifications of cells.  All through his life, he continued to work on these lines, modifying and improving this technique. Golgi received the highest honours and awards in recognition of his work. He shared the Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago Ramony Cajal for their work on the structure of the nervous system. 5.2.5 (iii) LYSOSOMES",
        "Structurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. These enzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances. Lysosomes are able to do this because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. During the disturbance in cellular metabolism,  for example, when the cell gets Fig. 5.6: Plant cell for some of the biochemical activities of the cell. In the liver cells of the group of animals called vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs. 5.2.5 (ii) GOLGI APPARATUS The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs) arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes [see 5.2.5 (iii)]. Reprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 57 57 57 57 57 damaged, lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their own cell. Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’ of a cell. 5.2.5 (iv) MITOCHONDRIA",
        "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings. The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATP- generating chemical reactions. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins. 5.2.5 (V) PLASTIDS Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored. The internal organisation of the Chloroplast consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma. These are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes. 5.2.5 (vi) VACUOLES Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles. The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume.",
        "In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell. Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include amino acids, sugars, various organic acids and some proteins. In single-celled organisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed. In some unicellular organisms, specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell."

Specific cells of reproductive organs or tissues in animals and plants divide to form gametes, which after fertilisation give rise to offspring. They divide by a different process called meiosis which involves two consecutive divisions. When a cell divides by meiosis it produces four new cells instead of just two (Fig. 5.8).

Cork is a substance\nwhich comes from the bark of a tree. This\nwas in the year 1665 when Hooke made this\nchance observation through a self-designed\nmicroscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes\ncells. Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little room’.\nThis may seem to be a very small and\ninsignificant incident but it is very important\nin the history of science. This was the very first\ntime that someone had observed that living\nthings appear to consist of separate units. The\nuse of the word ‘cell’ to describe these units is\nbeing used till this day in biology.\nLet us find out about cells.\n5.1 What are Living Organisms\nMade Up of?\nActivity ______________ 5.1\n•\nLet us take a small piece from an onion\nbulb. With the help of a pair of forceps,\nwe can peel off the skin (called\nepidermis) from the concave side (inner\nlayer) of the onion. This layer can be\nput immediately in a watch-glass\ncontaining water. This will prevent the\npeel from getting folded or getting dry.\nWhat do we do with this peel?\n•\nLet us take a glass slide, put a drop of\nwater on it and transfer a small piece\nof the peel from the watch glass to the\nslide. Make sure that the peel is\nperfectly flat on the slide. A thin camel\nhair paintbrush might be necessary to\nhelp transfer the peel. Now we put a\ndrop of safranin solution on this piece\nfollowed by a cover slip. Take care to\navoid air bubbles while putting the\ncover slip with the help of a mounting\nneedle. Ask your teacher for help. We\nhave prepared a temporary mount of\nonion peel. We can observe this slide\nunder low power followed by high\npowers of a compound microscope.\nFig. 5.1: Compound microscope\nWhat do we observe as we look through\nthe lens?

On the other hand,\nmany cells group together in a single body\nand assume different functions in it to form\nvarious body parts in multicellular organisms\n(multi = many) such as some fungi, plants\nand animals. Can we find out names of some\nmore unicellular organisms?\nEvery multi-cellular organism has come\nfrom a single cell. How? Cells divide to\nproduce cells of their own kind. All cells thus\ncome from pre-existing cells.\nActivity ______________ 5.2\n•\nWe can try preparing temporary\nmounts of leaf peels, tip of roots of\nonion or even peels of onions of different\nsizes.\n•\nAfter performing the above activity, let\nus see what the answers to the following\nquestions would be:\n(a) Do all cells look alike in terms of\nshape and size?\n(b) Do all cells look alike in structure?\n(c) Could we find differences among\ncells from different parts of a\nplant body?\n(d) What similarities could we find?\nSome organisms can also have cells of\ndifferent kinds. Look at the following picture.\nIt depicts some cells from the human body.\nSperm\nBone\ncell\nSmooth\nmuscle\ncell\nBlood\ncells\nOvum\nFig. 5.3: Various cells from the human body\nMore to know\nWe can try preparing temporary mounts\nof peels of onions of different sizes. What do\nwe observe? Do we see similar structures or\ndifferent structures?\nWhat are these structures?\nThese structures look similar to each other.\nTogether they form a big structure like an\nonion bulb! We find from this activity that\nonion bulbs of different sizes have similar\nsmall structures visible under a microscope.\nThe cells of the onion peel will all look the\nsame, regardless of the size of the onion they\ncame from.\nThese small structures that we see are\nthe basic building units of the onion bulb.\nThese structures are called cells. Not only\nonions, but all organisms that we observe\naround are made up of cells. However, there\nare also single cells that live on their own.\nCells were first discovered by\nRobert Hooke in 1665. He observed\nthe cells in a cork slice with the help\nof \na \nprimitive \nmicroscope.\nLeeuwenhoek (1674), with the\nimproved microscope, discovered the\nfree living cells in pond water for the\nfirst time. It was Robert Brown in\n1831 who discovered the nucleus in\nthe cell. Purkinje in 1839 coined the\nterm ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid\nsubstance of the cell. The cell theory,\nthat all the plants and animals are\ncomposed of cells and that the cell is\nthe basic unit of life, was presented\nby two biologists, Schleiden (1838)\nand Schwann (1839). The cell theory\nwas further expanded by Virchow\n(1855) by suggesting that all cells\narise from pre-existing cells. With the\ndiscovery of the electron microscope\nin 1940, it was possible to observe and\nunderstand the complex structure of\nthe cell and its various organelles.\nThe invention of magnifying lenses led to\nthe discovery of the microscopic world. It is\nnow known that a single cell may constitute\na whole organism as in Amoeba,\nNerve Cell\nFat cell\nReprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n\nThe shape and size of cells are related to\nthe specific function they perform. Some cells\nlike Amoeba have changing shapes. In some\ncases the cell shape could be more or less\nfixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell;\nfor example, nerve cells have a typical shape.\nEach living cell has the capacity to\nperform certain basic functions that are\ncharacteristic of all living forms. How does\na living cell perform these basic functions?\nWe know that there is a division of labour in\nmulticellular organisms such as human\nbeings. This means that different parts of\nthe human body perform different functions.\nThe human body has a heart to pump blood,\na stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly,\ndivision of labour is also seen within a single\ncell. In fact, each such cell has got certain\nspecific components within it known as cell\norganelles. Each kind of cell organelle\nperforms a special function, such as making\nnew material in the cell, clearing up the\nwaste material from the cell and so on. A\ncell is able to live and perform all its\nfunctions because of these organelles. These\norganelles together constitute the basic unit\ncalled the cell. It is interesting that all cells\nare found to have the same organelles, no\nmatter what their function is or what\norganism they are found in.\nuestions\n1.\nWho discovered cells, and how?\n2.\nWhy is the cell called the\nstructural and functional unit of\nlife?\n5.2 What is a Cell Made Up of?\nWhat is the Structural\nOrganisation of a Cell?\nWe saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called organelles. How is a cell\norganised?\nIf we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across three features in almost\nevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its environment\nare possible due to these features. Let us see\nhow.\n5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outermost covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell from its\nexternal environment. The plasma membrane\nallows or permits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials.\nThe cell membrane, therefore, is called a\nselectively permeable membrane.\nHow does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell?\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move across the cell membrane\nby a process called diffusion. We have studied\nthe process of diffusion in earlier chapters.\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance from a region of high\nconcentration to a region where its\nconcentration is low.\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and requires to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s\nexternal environment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compared to that inside the\ncell. As soon as there is a difference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of\nhigh concentration, to a region of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the process\nof diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe process of diffusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\nThus, diffusion plays an important role in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its external environment.\nWater also obeys the law of diffusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration.\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following three things could\nhappen:\n1.\nIf the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.\nIf the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.\nIf \nthe \nmedium \nhas \na \nlower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water crosses the cell\nmembrane in both directions, but this\ntime more water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Therefore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:\nActivity ______________ 5.3\n(a)\nRemove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes.\nWhat do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)\nPlace a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is more concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n•\nPut dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. You will\nobserve the following:\n(a)\nEach gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water.\n(b)\nHowever, when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater, and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water through\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, diffusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition from its environment. Different\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport requiring use\nof energy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of organic molecules called lipids\nand proteins. However, we can observe the\nstructure of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electron microscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\nReprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n\nActivity ______________ 5.5\n•\nFind out about electron microscopes\nfrom resources in the school library or\nthrough the internet. Discuss it with\nyour teacher.\nuestions\n1.\nHow do substances like CO2 and\nwater move in and out of the cell?\nDiscuss.\n2.\nWhy is the plasma membrane\ncalled a selectively permeable\nmembrane?\n5.2.2 CELL WALL\nPlant cells, in addition to the plasma\nmembrane, have another rigid outer covering\ncalled the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside\nthe plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is\nmainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a\ncomplex substance and provides structural\nstrength to plants.\nWhen a living plant cell loses water\nthrough osmosis there is shrinkage or\ncontraction of the contents of the cell away\nfrom the cell wall. This phenomenon is known\nas plasmolysis. We can observe this\nphenomenon by performing the following\nactivity:\nActivity ______________ 5.6\n•\nMount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water\non a slide and examine cells under\nthe high power of a microscope. Note\nthe small green granules, called\nchloroplasts. They contain a green\nsubstance called chlorophyll. Put a\nstrong solution of sugar or salt on the\nmounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a\nminute and observe under a\nmicroscope. What do we see?\n•\nNow place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling\nwater for a few minutes. This kills the\ncells. Then mount one leaf on a slide\nand observe it under a microscope. Put\na strong solution of sugar or salt on\nthe mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for\na minute and observe it again. What\ndo we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?\nWhat do we infer from this activity? It\nappears that only living cells, and not dead\ncells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.\nCell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) external media without bursting.\nIn such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis. The cell swells, building up\npressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts\nan equal pressure against the swollen cell.\nBecause of their walls, such cells can\nwithstand much greater changes in the\nsurrounding medium than animal cells.\n5.2.3 NUCLEUS\nRemember the temporary mount of onion peel\nwe prepared? We had put iodine solution on\nthe peel. Why? What would we see if we tried\nobserving the peel without putting the iodine\nsolution? Try it and see what the difference\nis. Further, when we put iodine solution on\nthe peel, did each cell get evenly coloured?\nAccording to their chemical composition\ndifferent regions of cells get coloured\ndifferentially. Some regions appear darker\nthan other regions. Apart from iodine solution\nwe could also use safranin solution or\nmethylene blue solution to stain the cells.\nWe have observed cells from an onion; let\nus now observe cells from our own body.\nActivity ______________ 5.7\n•\nLet us take a glass slide with a drop of\nwater on it. Using an ice-cream spoon\ngently scrape the inside surface of the\ncheek. Does any material get stuck on\nthe spoon? With the help of a needle\nwe can transfer this material and\nspread it evenly on the glass slide kept\nready for this. To colour the material\nwe can put a drop of methylene blue\nsolution on it. Now the material is ready\nfor observation under microscope. Do\nnot forget to put a cover-slip on it!\n•\nWhat do we observe? What is the\nshape of the cells we see? Draw it on\nthe observation sheet.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n•\nWas there a darkly coloured, spherical\nor oval, dot-like structure near the\ncentre of each cell? This structure is\ncalled nucleus. Were there similar\nstructures in onion peel cells?\nThe nucleus has a double layered covering\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\nmembrane has pores which allow the transfer\nof material from inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\nThe nucleus contains chromosomes,\nwhich are visible as rod-shaped structures\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\nChromosomes contain information for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are\ncomposed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules\ncontain the information necessary for\nconstructing and organising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is present as\npart of chromatin material. Chromatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thread\nlike structures. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin material gets organised\ninto chromosomes.\nThe nucleus plays a central role in cellular\nreproduction, the process by which a single\ncell divides and forms two new cells. It also\nplays a crucial part, along with the\nenvironment, in determining the way the cell\nwill develop and what form it will exhibit at\nmaturity, by directing the chemical activities\nof the cell.\nIn some organisms like bacteria, the\nnuclear region of the cell may be poorly\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear region\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\nnucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack\na nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon\n= nucleus). Organisms with cells having a\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organelles\npresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\nfunctions of such organelles are also\nperformed by poorly organised parts of the\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlorophyll\nin photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is\nassociated with membranous vesicles (bag\nlike structures) but not with plastids as in\neukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5).\nRibosomes\nPlasma\nmembrane\nCell wall\nNucleoid\nFig. 5.4: Prokaryotic cell\n5.2.4 CYTOPLASM\nWhen we look at the temporary mounts of\nonion peel as well as human cheek cells, we\ncan see a large region of each cell enclosed\nby the cell membrane. This region takes up\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\nspecialised cell organelles. Each of these\norganelles performs a specific function for the\ncell.\nCell organelles are enclosed by\nmembranes. In prokaryotes, beside the\nabsence of a defined nuclear region, the\nmembrane-bound cell organelles are also\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\nmembrane-enclosed organelles.\nThe significance of membranes can be\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\na living body and use its cell machinery to\nmultiply.\nReprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n\nuestion\n1.\nFill in the gaps in the following\ntable illustrating differences\nbetween \nprokaryotic \nand\neukaryotic cells.\nProkaryotic Cell\nEukaryotic Cell\n1.

Large and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular organisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structure and function. To\nkeep these activities of different kinds\nseparate from each other, these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of\nthe features of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some\nof these organelles are visible only with an\nelectron microscope.\nWe have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell organelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells.\n5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or round or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structure to the plasma membrane.\nThere are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a\nmicroscope because it has particles called\nribosomes attached to its surface. The\nribosomes, which are present in all active\ncells, are the sites of protein manufacture.\nThe manufactured proteins are then sent to\nvarious places in the cell depending on need,\nusing the ER. The SER helps in the\nmanufacture of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This process is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other proteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones. Although the ER varies greatly in\nappearance in different cells, it always forms a\nnetwork system.\nQ\nFig. 5.5: Animal cell\nThus, one function of the ER is to serve as\nchannels for the transport of materials\n(especially proteins) between various regions\nof the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm\nand the nucleus. The ER also functions as a\ncytoplasmic framework providing a surface\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nCamillo Golgi was born at\nCorteno near Brescia in\n1843. \nHe \nstudied\nmedicine at the University\nof Pavia. After graduating\nin 1865, he continued to\nwork in Pavia at the\nHospital of St. Matteo. At\nthat time most of his\ninvestigations \nwere\nconcerned with the nervous system, In 1872\nhe accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer\nat the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at\nAbbiategrasso. He first started his\ninvestigations into the nervous system in a\nlittle kitchen of this hospital, which he had\nconverted into a laboratory. However, the\nwork of greatest importance, which Golgi\ncarried out was a revolutionary method of\nstaining individual nerve and cell structures.\nThis method is referred to as the ‘black\nreaction’. This method uses a weak solution\nof silver nitrate and is particularly valuable\nin tracing the processes and most delicate\nramifications of cells. All through his life,\nhe continued to work on these lines,\nmodifying and improving this technique.\nGolgi received the highest honours and\nawards in recognition of his work. He shared\nthe Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago\nRamony Cajal for their work on the structure\nof the nervous system.\n5.2.5 (iii) LYSOSOMES\nStructurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound\nsacs filled with digestive enzymes. These\nenzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\norganelles. Foreign materials entering the cell,\nsuch as bacteria or food, as well as old\norganelles end up in the lysosomes, which\nbreak complex substances into simpler\nsubstances. Lysosomes are able to do this\nbecause they contain powerful digestive\nenzymes capable of breaking down all organic\nmaterial. During the disturbance in cellular\nmetabolism, for example, when the cell gets\nFig. 5.6: Plant cell\nfor some of the biochemical activities of the\ncell. In the liver cells of the group of animals\ncalled vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays\na crucial role in detoxifying many poisons\nand drugs.\n5.2.5 (ii) GOLGI APPARATUS\nThe Golgi apparatus, first described by\nCamillo Golgi, consists of a system of\nmembrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs)\narranged approximately parallel to each other\nin stacks called cisterns. These membranes\noften have connections with the membranes\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\npackaged and dispatched to various targets\ninside and outside the cell through the Golgi\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\nmodification and packaging of products in\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\n5.2.5 (iii)].\nReprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n\n\n\n\n\ndamaged, lysosomes may burst and the\nenzymes digest their own cell. Therefore,\nlysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’\nof a cell.\n5.2.5 (iv) MITOCHONDRIA\nMitochondria are known as the powerhouses\nof the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules.\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work.\nMitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins.\n5.2.5 (V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids – chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\nThe internal organisation of the Chloroplast\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\nare similar to mitochondria in external\nstructure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also\nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n5.2.5 (vi) VACUOLES\nVacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid\ncontents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles.\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.\nIn plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\nMany substances of importance in the life of\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\norganisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba has\nconsumed. In some unicellular organisms,\nspecialised vacuoles also play important roles\nin expelling excess water and some wastes\nfrom the cell.\nuestions\n1.\nCan you name the two organelles\nwe have studied that contain\ntheir own genetic material?\n2.\nIf the organisation of a cell is\ndestroyed due to some physical\nor chemical influence, what will\nhappen?\n3.\nWhy are lysosomes known as\nsuicide bags?\n4.\nWhere are proteins synthesised\ninside the cell?\nEach cell thus acquires its structure and\nability to function because of the organisation\nof its membrane and organelles in specific\nways. The cell thus has a basic structural\norganisation. This helps the cells to perform\nfunctions like respiration, obtaining nutrition,\nand clearing of waste material, or forming\nnew proteins.\nThus, the cell is the fundamental structural\nunit of living organisms. It is also the basic\nfunctional unit of life.\nCell Division\nCell Division\nCell Division\nCell Division\nCell Division\nNew cells are formed in organisms in order to\ngrow, to replace old, dead and injured cells,\nand to form gametes required for\nreproduction. The process by which new cells\nare made is called cell division. There are two\nmain types of cell division: mitosis\nand meiosis.\nThe process of cell division by which most\nof the cells divide for growth is called mitosis.\nIn this process, each cell called mother cell\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n·\nThe fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell.\n·\nCells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids\nand proteins.\n·\nThe cell membrane is an active part of the cell. It regulates\nthe movement of materials between the ordered interior of\nthe cell and the outer environment.\n·\nIn plant cells, a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is\nlocated outside the cell membrane.\n·\nThe presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants,\nfungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without\nbursting.\n·\nThe nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm\nby double-layered membrane and it directs the life processes\nof the cell.\n·\nThe ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular\ntransport and as a manufacturing surface.\n·\nThe Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound\nvesicles that function in the storage, modification and\npackaging of substances manufactured in the cell.\n·\nMost plant cells have large membranous organelles called\nplastids, which are of two types—chromoplasts and\nleucoplasts.\nFig. 5.7:\nFig. 5.7:\nFig. 5.7:\nFig. 5.7:\nFig. 5.7: Mitosis\nFig. 5.8:\nFig. 5.8:\nFig. 5.8:\nFig. 5.8:\nFig. 5.8: Meiosis\ndivides to form two identical daughter cells\n(Fig. 5.7). The daughter cells have the same\nnumber of chromosomes as mother cell. It\nhelps in growth and repair of tissues\nin organisms.\nSpecific cells of reproductive organs or tissues\nin animals and plants divide to form gametes,\nwhich after fertilisation give rise to offspring.\nThey divide by a different process called\nmeiosis which involves two consecutive\ndivisions. When a cell divides by meiosis it\nproduces four new cells instead of just two (Fig.\n5.8). The new cells only have half the number\nof chromosomes than that of the mother cells.\nCan you think as to why the chromosome\nnumber has reduced to half in daughter cells?\nChromosomes\nMother cell\nMother cell\nDaughter\ncells\nDaughter\ncells\nMeiosis-I\nMeiosis-II\nReprint 2025-26 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n\n•\nChromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts\nand they perform photosynthesis.\n•\nThe primary function of leucoplasts is storage.\n•\nMost mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that\nhelps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores\nimportant substances including wastes.\n•\nProkaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, their\nchromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid, and they\nhave only very small ribosomes as organelles.\n•\nCells in organisms divide for growth of body, for repalcing\ndead cells, and for forming gametes for reproduction.\nExercises\n1.\nMake a comparison and write down ways in which plant\ncells are different from animal cells.\n2.\nHow is a prokaryotic cell different from a eukaryotic cell?\n3.\nWhat would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or\nbreaks down?\n4.\nWhat would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi\napparatus?\n5.\nWhich organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell?
