        "draws diagrams, organises her thoughts, collects question papers, attends classes, discusses problems with her friends, and performs experiments.  She expends a lot of energy on these activities. In common parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by the scientific definition of work. You are working hard to push a huge rock. Let us say the rock does not move despite all the effort. You get completely exhausted. However, you have not done any work on the rock as there is no displacement of the rock. You stand still for a few minutes with a heavy load on your head.   You get tired. You have exerted yourself and have spent quite a bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the load?  The way we understand the term ‘work’ in science, work is not done. You climb up the steps of a staircase and reach the second floor of a building just to see the landscape from there.  You may even climb up a tall tree.  If we apply the scientific definition, these activities involve a lot of work. In day-to-day life, we consider any useful physical or mental labour as work. Activities like playing in a field, talking with friends, humming a tune, watching a movie, attending a function are sometimes not considered to be work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends on the way we define it. We use and define the term work differently in science.  To understand this let us do the following activities:"

        "FORCE",
        "How is work defined in science? To understand this, we shall first consider the case when the force is acting in the direction of displacement. Let a constant force, F act on an object. Let the object be displaced through a distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work to be equal to the product of the force and displacement. Work done = force × displacement W = F s  (10.1)",

        "10.1.2SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK",
        "To understand the way we view work and define work from the point of view of science, let us consider some situations: Push a pebble lying on a surface. The pebble moves through a distance. You exerted a force on the pebble and the pebble got displaced. In this situation work is done. A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves through a distance.  The girl has exerted a force on the trolley and it is displaced. Therefore, work is done. Lift a book through a height. To do this you must apply a force.  The book rises up. There is a force applied on the book and the book has moved.  Hence, work is done. A closer look at the above situations reveals that two conditions need to be satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced. If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. This is the way we view work in science. A bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart moves. There is a force on the cart and the cart has moved. Do you think that work is done in this situation?"

        "Fig. 10.1",
        "Thus, work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction. In Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then the work done by the force will be 1 N m. Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule  (J).  Thus 1 J is the amount of work",

What would be the work done when the displacement of the object is zero? Refer to the conditions that are to be satisfied to say that work is done.",
        "Example 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on an object. The object is displaced through 2 m in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object all through the displacement, then work done is 5 N × 2 m  =10 N m or 10 J.",

That is, the angle between the two directions is 180º. Let the object stop after a displacement s. In such a situation, the work done by the force, F is taken as negative and denoted by the minus sign. The work done by the force is F × (–s) or (–F × s). It is clear from the above discussion that the work done by a force can be either positive or negative. To understand this, let us do the following activity:"

        "raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece of wood, it drives the nail into the wood. We have also observed children winding a toy (such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed on the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon is filled with air and we press it we notice a change in its shape. As long as we press it gently, it can come back to its original shape when the force is withdrawn. However, if we press the balloon hard, it can even explode producing a blasting sound. In all these examples, the objects acquire, through different means, the capability of doing work. An object having a capability to do work is said to possess energy. The object which does the work loses energy and the object on which the work is done gains energy. How does an object with energy do work? An object that possesses energy can exert a force on another object. When this happens, energy is transferred from the former to the latter. The second object may move as it receives energy and therefore do some work. Thus, the first object had a capacity  to do work. This implies that any object that possesses energy can do work. The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in  terms of  its  capacity of doing work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the energy required to do 1 joule of work. Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.",

In short, kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed.

This is the potential energy (EP) of the object. Ep = mgh (10.6)",

        "In activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another. What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total energy remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid                  in all situations and for all kinds of transformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object of mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height, h. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be ½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the potential energy would decrease while the kinetic energy would increase. When the object is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least.  However, the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of the object would be the same at all points. That is, potential energy + kinetic energy = constant    or",
        "1 constant. 2",
        "2 mgh + mv = (10.7)",
        "The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy. We find that during the free fall of the object, the decrease in potential energy, at any point in its path, appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of air resistance on the motion of the object has been ignored.) There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.",

We talk of the power of machines like motorbikes and motorcars. The speed with which these vehicles change energy or do work is a basis for their classification.  Power measures the speed of work done, that is, how fast or slow work is done. Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy.

We express larger rates of energy transfer in kilowatts (kW). 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts 1 kW = 1000 W 1 kW = 1000 J s–1. The power of an agent may vary with time.

  "full_text": "In the previous few chapters we have talked\nabout ways of describing the motion of\nobjects, the cause of motion and gravitation.\nAnother concept that helps us understand and\ninterpret many natural phenomena is ‘work’.\nClosely related to work are energy and power.\nIn this chapter we shall study these concepts.\nAll living beings need food. Living beings\nhave to perform several basic activities to\nsurvive. We call such activities ‘life processes’.\nThe energy for these processes comes from\nfood. We need energy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, reading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running. Activities that\nare strenuous require more energy.\nAnimals too get engaged in activities. For\nexample, they may jump and run. They have\nto fight, move away from enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields. All such activities\nrequire energy.\nThink of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines require\nfuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy?\n10.1 Work\nWhat is work? There is a difference in the\nway we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science. To make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\n10.1.1 NOT MUCH ‘WORK’ IN SPITE OF\nWORKING HARD!\nKamali is preparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She reads books,\ndraws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses problems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments. She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou are working hard to push a huge rock.\nLet us say the rock does not move despite all\nthe effort. You get completely exhausted.\nHowever, you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the rock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head. You get tired. You\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Are you doing work on the\nload? The way we understand the term ‘work’\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a staircase and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape from there. You may even\nclimb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function are sometimes not considered to\nbe work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends\non the way we define it. We use and define\nthe term work differently in science. To\nunderstand this let us do the following\nactivities:\nActivity _____________10.1\n•\nWe have discussed in the above\nparagraphs a number of activities\nwhich we normally consider to be work\n\nWORK\nORK\nORK\nORK\nORK AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND E\n E\n E\n E\n ENERGY\nNERGY\nNERGY\nNERGY\nNERGY\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nActivity _____________10.3\n•\nThink of situations when the object\nis not displaced in spite of a force\nacting on it.\n•\nAlso think of situations when an object\ngets displaced in the absence of a force\nacting on it.\n•\nList all the situations that you can\nthink of for each.\n•\nDiscuss with your friends whether\nwork is done in these situations.\n10.1.3 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT\nFORCE\nHow is work defined in science? To\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the force is acting in the direction\nof displacement.\nLet a constant force, F act on an object.\nLet the object be displaced through a\ndistance, s in the direction of the force (Fig.\n10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work\nto be equal to the product of the force and\ndisplacement.\nWork done = force × displacement\nW\n= F s\n (10.1)\nin day-to-day life. For each of these\nactivities, ask the following questions\nand answer them:\n(i) What is the work being done on?\n(ii) What is happening to the object?\n(iii) Who (what) is doing the work?\n10.1.2SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK\nTo understand the way we view work and\ndefine work from the point of view of science,\nlet us consider some situations:\nPush a pebble lying on a surface. The\npebble moves through a distance. You exerted\na force on the pebble and the pebble got\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\nA girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves\nthrough a distance. The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\nTherefore, work is done.\nLift a book through a height. To do this\nyou must apply a force. The book rises up.\nThere is a force applied on the book and the\nbook has moved. Hence, work is done.\nA closer look at the above situations\nreveals that two conditions need to be\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\ndisplaced.\nIf any one of the above conditions does\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\nwe view work in science.\nA bullock is pulling a cart. The cart\nmoves. There is a force on the cart and the\ncart has moved. Do you think that work is\ndone in this situation?\nActivity _____________10.2\n•\nThink of some situations from your\ndaily life involving work.\n•\nList them.\n•\nDiscuss with your friends whether\nwork is being done in each situation.\n•\nTry to reason out your response.\n•\nIf work is done, which is the force acting\non the object?\n•\nWhat is the object on which the work\nis done?\n•\nWhat happens to the object on which\nwork is done?\nFig. 10.1\nThus, work done by a force acting on an\nobject is equal to the magnitude of the force\nmultiplied by the distance moved in the\ndirection of the force. Work has only\nmagnitude and no direction.\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then\nthe work done by the force will be 1 N m.\nHere the unit of work is newton metre (N m)\nor joule (J). Thus 1 J is the amount of work\nReprint 2025-26 WORK AND ENERGY\n\ndone on an object when a force of 1 N\ndisplaces it by 1 m along the line of action of\nthe force.\nLook at Eq. (10.1) carefully. What is the\nwork done when the force on the object is\nzero? What would be the work done when\nthe displacement of the object is zero? Refer\nto the conditions that are to be satisfied to\nsay that work is done.\nExample 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on\nan object. The object is displaced\nthrough 2 m in the direction of the force\n(Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object\nall through the displacement, then work\ndone is 5 N × 2 m =10 N m or 10 J.\nFig. 10.4\nConsider a situation in which an object is\nmoving with a uniform velocity along a\nparticular direction. Now a retarding force, F,\nis applied in the opposite direction. That is,\nthe angle between the two directions is 180º.\nLet the object stop after a displacement s. In\nsuch a situation, the work done by the force,\nF is taken as negative and denoted by the\nminus sign. The work done by the force is\nF × (–s) or (–F × s).\nIt is clear from the above discussion that\nthe work done by a force can be either positive\nor negative. To understand this, let us do the\nfollowing activity:\nActivity _____________10.4\n•\nLift an object up. Work is done by the\nforce exerted by you on the object. The\nobject moves upwards. The force you\nexerted is in the direction of\ndisplacement. However, there is the\nforce of gravity acting on the object.\n•\nWhich one of these forces is doing\npositive work?\n•\nWhich one is doing negative work?\n•\nGive reasons.\nWork done is negative when the force acts\nopposite to the direction of displacement.\nWork done is positive when the force is in the\ndirection of displacement.\nExample 10.2 A porter lifts a luggage of\n15 kg from the ground and puts it on\nhis head 1.5 m above the ground.\nCalculate the work done by him on the\nluggage.\nSolution:\nMass of luggage, m = 15 kg and\ndisplacement, s = 1.5 m.\nFig. 10.2\nuestion\n1.\nA force of 7 N acts on an object.\nThe displacement is, say 8 m, in\nthe direction of the force\n(Fig. 10.3). Let us take it that the\nforce acts on the object through\nthe displacement.

The baby\nhas exerted a force in the direction of\ndisplacement of the car. In this situation, the\nwork done will be equal to the product of the\nforce and displacement. In such situations,\nthe work done by the force is taken as positive.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nraised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece\nof wood, it drives the nail into the wood. We\nhave also observed children winding a toy\n(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed\non the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon\nis filled with air and we press it we notice a\nchange in its shape. As long as we press it\ngently, it can come back to its original shape\nwhen the force is withdrawn. However, if we\npress the balloon hard, it can even explode\nproducing a blasting sound. In all these\nexamples, the objects acquire, through\ndifferent means, the capability of doing work.\nAn object having a capability to do work is\nsaid to possess energy. The object which does\nthe work loses energy and the object on which\nthe work is done gains energy.\nHow does an object with energy do work?\nAn object that possesses energy can exert a\nforce on another object. When this happens,\nenergy is transferred from the former to the\nlatter. The second object may move as it\nreceives energy and therefore do some work.\nThus, the first object had a capacity to do\nwork. This implies that any object that\npossesses energy can do work.\nThe energy possessed by an object is thus\nmeasured in terms of its capacity of doing\nwork. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same\nas that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the\nenergy required to do 1 joule of work.\nSometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo\njoule (k J) is used. 1 k J equals 1000 J.\n10.2.1 FORMS OF ENERGY\nLuckily the world we live in provides energy in\nmany different forms.

Where do we\nget energy from? The Sun is the biggest\nnatural source of energy to us. Many of our\nenergy sources are derived from the Sun.

Let us consider the\nfollowing examples: when a fast moving\ncricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket\nis thrown away.

An object\nmoving faster can do more work than an\nidentical object moving relatively slow. A\nmoving bullet, blowing wind, a rotating wheel,\na speeding stone can do work. How does a\nbullet pierce the target? How does the wind\nmove the blades of a windmill? Objects in\nmotion possess energy. We call this energy\nkinetic energy.\nA falling coconut, a speeding car, a rolling\nstone, a flying aircraft, flowing water, blowing\nwind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic\nenergy. In short, kinetic energy is the energy\npossessed by an object due to its motion. The\nkinetic energy of an object increases with its\nspeed.\nHow much energy is possessed by a\nmoving body by virtue of its motion?

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential energy of an\nobject at a point above the ground is defined\nas the work done in raising it from the ground\nto that point against gravity.\nIt is easy to arrive at an expression for\nthe gravitational potential energy of an object\nat a height.\nFig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\nraised through a height, h from the ground.\nA force is required to do this. The minimum\nforce required to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it. Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W = force × displacement\n= mg × h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy (EP)\nof the object.\nEp = mgh\n(10.6)\nMore to know\nThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose. An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level.\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\nheights of the initial and final positions of\nthe object and not on the path along which\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\nwhere a block is raised from position A to B\nby taking two different paths. Let the height\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\non the object is mgh.\nFig. 10.8\nExample 10.5 Find the energy possessed\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\na height of 6 m above the ground. Given,\ng = 9.8 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m = 10 kg,\ndisplacement (height), h = 6 m, and\nacceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2.\nFrom Eq. (10.6),\nPotential energy = mgh\n=\n10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m\n=\n588 J.\nThe potential energy is 588 J.\nReprint 2025-26 WORK AND ENERGY\n\nExample 10.6 An object of mass 12 kg is\nat a certain height above the ground.\nIf the potential energy of the object is\n480 J, find the height at which the\nobject is with respect to the ground.\nGiven, g = 10 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m = 12 kg,\npotential energy, Ep = 480 J.\n Ep = mgh\n480 J = 12 kg × 10 m s–2 × h\n h\n=\n–2\n480 J\n120 kg m s\n = 4 m.\nThe object is at the height of 4 m.\n10.2.5 ARE VARIOUS ENERGY FORMS\nINTERCONVERTIBLE?\nCan we convert energy from one form to\nanother? We find in nature a number of\ninstances of conversion of energy from one\nform to another.\nActivity ___________ 10.13\n•\nSit in small groups.\n•\nDiscuss the various ways of energy\nconversion in nature.\n•\nDiscuss following questions in your\ngroup:\n(a) How do green plants produce food?\n(b) Where do they get their energy from?\n(c) Why does the air move from place\nto place?\n(d) How are fuels, such as coal and\npetroleum formed?\n(e) What kinds of energy conversions\nsustain the water cycle?\nActivity ___________ 10.14\n•\nMany of the human activities and the\ngadgets we use involve conversion of\nenergy from one form to another.\n•\nMake a list of such activities and\ngadgets.\n•\nIdentify in each activity/gadget the\nkind of energy conversion that takes\nplace.\n10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\nIn activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that\nthe form of energy can be changed from one\nform to another. What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast. However, the sum of the potential energy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n or\n\nconstant.\n\n\nmgh +\nmv =\n(10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the free fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nA stronger person may do certain work in\nrelatively less time. A more powerful vehicle\nwould complete a journey in a shorter time\nthan a less powerful one. We talk of the power\nof machines like motorbikes and motorcars.\nThe speed with which these vehicles change\nenergy or do work is a basis for their\nclassification. Power measures the speed of\nwork done, that is, how fast or slow work is\ndone. Power is defined as the rate of doing\nwork or the rate of transfer of energy. If an\nagent does a work W in time t, then power is\ngiven by:\nPower = work/time\nor\nW\nP =\nt\n(10.8)\nThe unit of power is watt [in honour of\nJames Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol\nW. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which\ndoes work at the rate of 1 joule per second.\nWe can also say that power is 1 W when the\nrate of consumption of energy is 1 J s–1.\n1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1.\nWe express larger rates of energy transfer in\nkilowatts (k W).\n1 kilowatt\n= 1000 watts\n1 k W\n= 1000 W\n1 k W\n= 1000 J s–1.\nThe power of an agent may vary with time.\nThis means that the agent may be doing work\nat different rates at different intervals of time.\nTherefore the concept of average power is\nuseful. We obtain average power by dividing\nthe total energy consumed by the total time\ntaken.\nExample 10.7 Two girls, each of weight 400\nN climb up a rope through a height of 8\nm.

Is it a violation of the law of conservation of\nenergy?\n16.\nAn object of mass, m is moving with a constant velocity, v.\nHow much work should be done on the object in order to\nbring the object to rest?\n17.\nCalculate the work required to be done to stop a car of 1500\nkg moving at a velocity of 60 km/h?\n18.\nIn each of the following a force, F is acting on an object of\nmass, m. The direction of displacement is from west to east\nshown by the longer arrow. Observe the diagrams carefully\nand state whether the work done by the force is negative,\npositive or zero.\n19.\nSoni says that the acceleration in an object could be zero\neven when several forces are acting on it. Do you agree with\nher? Why?\n20.\nFind the energy in joules consumed in 10 hours by four\ndevices of power 500 W each.\n21.\nA freely falling object eventually stops on reaching the\nground. What happenes to its kinetic energy?\nReprint 2025-26"
