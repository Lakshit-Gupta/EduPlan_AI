And oil seeds including soyabean, ground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and sunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig. 12.1). Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a range of vitamins and minerals in addition to small amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops like berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as food for the livestock."

Paddy, soyabean, pigeon pea, maize, cotton, green gram and black gram are kharif crops, whereas wheat, gram, peas, mustard, linseed are rabi crops. In India there has been a four times increase in the production of food grains from 1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the cultivable land area. How has this increase in production been achieved? If we think of the practices involved in farming, we can see that we can divide it into three stages. The first is the choice of seeds for planting. The second is the nurturing of the crop plants. The third is the protection of the growing and harvested crops from loss. Thus, the major groups of activities for improving crop yields can be classified as: • Crop variety improvement • Crop production improvement • Crop protection management.",
        "12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT",
        "This approach depends on finding a crop variety that can give a good yield. Varieties or strains of crops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease resistance, response to fertilisers, product quality and high yields. One way of incorporating desirable characters into crop varieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation refers to crossing between genetically dissimilar plants. This crossing may be intervarietal (between different varieties), interspecific (between two different species of the same genus) or intergeneric (between different genera). Another way of improving the crop is by introducing a gene that would provide the desired characteristic. This results in genetically modified crops. For new varieties of crops to be accepted, it is necessary that the variety produces high yields under different conditions that are found in different areas. Farmers would need to be provided with good quality seeds of a particular variety, that is, the seeds should all",

Since weather conditions such as drought  and  flood  situations  are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful. Similarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity have been developed. Some of the factors for which variety improvement is done are: • Higher yield: To increase the productivity of the crop per acre. • Improved  quality:  Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop. Baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables. • Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. • Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. Such short durations allow farmers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year. Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production. Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting. • Wider adaptability: Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under different environmental conditions. One variety can then be grown under different climatic conditions in different areas. • Desirable agronomic characteristics: Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops. Dwarfness is desired in cereals, so that"

        "In India, as in many other agriculture-based countries, farming ranges from small to very large farms. Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies. In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies. There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices. Therefore, production practices can be at different levels. They include ‘no cost’ production, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high cost’ production practices.",

        "Just as we need food for development, growth and well-being, plants also require nutrients for growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants by air, water and soil. There are several nutrients which are essential for plants. Air supplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes from water, and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1)."

The compost is rich in organic matter and nutrients. Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is called vermi-compost.

Fertilizers should be applied carefully in terms of proper dose, time, and observing pre- and post-application precautions for their complete utilisation. For example, sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and are not fully absorbed by the plants. This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution.

        "India has a wide variety of water resources and a highly varied climate. Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available. These include wells, canals, rivers and tanks. • Wells:  There are two types of wells, namely dug wells and tube wells. In a dug well, water is collected from water bearing strata. Tube wells can tap water from the deeper strata. From these wells, water is lifted by pumps for irrigation. • Canals: This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system. In this system canals receive water from one or more reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is divided into branch canals having further distributaries to irrigate fields. • River Lift Systems: In areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate reservoir release, the lift system is more rational. Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers. • Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas. Fresh initiatives for increasing the water available for agriculture include rainwater harvesting and watershed management. This involves building small check-dams which lead to an increase in ground water levels. The check-dams stop the rainwater from flowing away and also reduce soil erosion.",

Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest. Generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: (i) they cut the root, stem and leaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem and fruits. They thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields. Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These pathogens can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air. Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods. One of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil. However, excessive use of these chemicals creates problems, since they can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution. Weed control methods also include mechanical removal. Preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation also help in weed control. Some other preventive measures against pests are the use of resistant varieties, and summer ploughing, in which fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy weeds and pests."

Care is taken to avoid mortality and to maintain feathering and carcass quality. They are produced as broilers and sent to market for meat purposes. For good production of poultry birds, good management practices are important. These include maintenance of temperature and hygienic conditions in housing and poultry feed, as well as prevention and control of diseases and pests. The  housing,  nutritional  and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhat different from those of egg layers."

Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs. While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish production from these resources is through aquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field. More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems. Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems.",
        "In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fishpond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits. As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together these species (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other. This increases the fish yield from the pond.",

To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities.",

They stay in a given beehive for long periods, and breed very well. For commercial honey production, bee farms or apiaries are established. The value or quality of honey depends upon the pasturage, or the flowers available to the bees for nectar and pollen collection. In addition to adequate quantity of pasturage, the kind of flowers available will determine the taste of the honey."

  "full_text": "SCIENCE\n\nWe know that all living organisms need food.\nFood supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats,\nvitamins and minerals, all of which we require\nfor body development, growth and health.\nBoth plants and animals are major sources\nof food for us. We obtain most of this food\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry.\nWe read in newspapers that efforts are\nalways being made to improve production\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the current levels of production?\nIndia is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is more than one billion people,\nand it is still growing. As food for this growing\npopulation, we will soon need more than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year.\nThis can be done by farming on more land.\nBut India is already intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the area of land under cultivation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to increase our\nproduction efficiency for both crops and\nlivestock.\nEfforts to meet the food demand by\nincreasing food production have led to some\nsuccesses so far. We have had the green\nrevolution, which contributed to increased\nfood-grain production. We have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk.\nHowever, these revolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively. As a result, there are more\nchances of causing damage to our natural\nresources to the point of destroying their\nbalance completely. Therefore, it is important\nthat we should increase food production\nwithout degrading our environment and\ndisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence,\nthere is a need for sustainable practices in\nagriculture and animal husbandry.\nAlso, simply increasing grain production\nfor storage in warehouses cannot solve the\nproblem of malnutrition and hunger. People\nshould have money to purchase food. Food\nsecurity depends on both availability of food\nand access to it. The majority of our\npopulation depends on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Increasing the incomes of people\nworking in agriculture is therefore necessary\nto combat the problem of hunger. Scientific\nmanagement practices should be undertaken\nto obtain high yields from farms. For\nsustained livelihood, one should undertake\nmixed farming, intercropping, and integrated\nfarming practices, for example, combine\nagriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/\nbee-keeping.\nThe question thus becomes – how do we\nincrease the yields of crops and livestock?\n12.1 Improvement in Crop Yields\nCereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and\nsorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy\nrequirement. Pulses like gram (chana), pea\n(matar), black gram (urad), green gram (moong),\npigeon pea (arhar), lentil (masoor), provide us with\nprotein. And oil seeds including soyabean,\nground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and\nsunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig.\n12.1). Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a\nrange of vitamins and minerals in addition to\nsmall amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and\nfats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops\nlike berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as\nfood for the livestock.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT IN\nIN\nIN\nIN\nIN F\n F\n F\n F\n FOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD R\n R\n R\n R\n RESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES\n\nthe kharif season from the month of June to\nOctober, and some of the crops are grown in\nthe winter season, called the rabi season from\nNovember to April. Paddy, soyabean, pigeon\npea, maize, cotton, green gram and black\ngram are kharif crops, whereas wheat, gram,\npeas, mustard, linseed are rabi crops.\nIn India there has been a four times\nincrease in the production of food grains from\n1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the\ncultivable land area. How has this increase\nin production been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in farming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into three stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the crop plants.\nThe third is the protection of the growing and\nharvested crops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for improving crop yields\ncan be classified as:\n•\nCrop variety improvement\n•\nCrop production improvement\n•\nCrop protection management.\n12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. Varieties or\nstrains of crops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease resistance, response to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into crop\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to crossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants. This crossing may be\nintervarietal (between different varieties),\ninterspecific (between two different species of\nthe same genus) or intergeneric (between\ndifferent genera). Another way of improving\nthe crop is by introducing a gene that would\nprovide the desired characteristic. This\nresults in genetically modified crops.\nFor new varieties of crops to be accepted,\nit is necessary that the variety produces high\nyields under different conditions that are\nfound in different areas. Farmers would need\nto be provided with good quality seeds of a\nparticular variety, that is, the seeds should all\nFig. 12.1: Different types of crops\nuestion\n1.\nWhat do we get from cereals,\npulses, fruits and vegetables?\nDifferent crops require different climatic\nconditions, temperature and photoperiods for\ntheir growth and completion of their life cycle.\nPhotoperiods are related to the duration of\nsunlight. Growth of plants and flowering are\ndependent on sunlight. As we all know, plants\nmanufacture their food in sunlight by the\nprocess of photosynthesis. There are some\ncrops, which are grown in rainy season, called\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nbe of the same variety and germinate under\nthe same conditions.\nCultivation practices and crop yield are\nrelated to weather, soil quality and availability\nof water. Since weather conditions such as\ndrought \nand \nflood \nsituations \nare\nunpredictable, varieties that can be grown in\ndiverse climatic conditions are useful.\nSimilarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity\nhave been developed. Some of the factors for\nwhich variety improvement is done are:\n•\nHigher yield: To increase the\nproductivity of the crop per acre.\n•\nImproved \nquality: \nQuality\nconsiderations of crop products vary\nfrom crop to crop. Baking quality is\nimportant in wheat, protein quality in\npulses, oil quality in oilseeds and\npreserving quality in fruits and\nvegetables.\n•\nBiotic and abiotic resistance: Crops\nproduction can go down due to biotic\n(diseases, insects and nematodes) and\nabiotic (drought, salinity, water\nlogging, heat, cold and frost) stresses\nunder different situations. Varieties\nresistant to these stresses can improve\ncrop production.\n•\nChange in maturity duration: The\nshorter the duration of the crop from\nsowing to harvesting, the more\neconomical is the variety. Such short\ndurations allow farmers to grow\nmultiple rounds of crops in a year.\nShort duration also reduces the cost\nof crop production. Uniform maturity\nmakes the harvesting process easy\nand reduces losses during harvesting.\n•\nWider adaptability: Developing\nvarieties for wider adaptability will\nhelp in stabilising the crop production\nunder different environmental\nconditions. One variety can then be\ngrown under different climatic\nconditions in different areas.\n•\nDesirable agronomic characteristics:\nTallness and profuse branching are\ndesirable characters for fodder crops.\nDwarfness is desired in cereals, so that\nless nutrients are consumed by these\ncrops. Thus developing varieties of\ndesired agronomic characters help give\nhigher productivity.\nuestions\n1.\nHow do biotic and abiotic factors\naffect crop production?\n2.\nWhat are the desirable agronomic\ncharacteristics \nfor \ncrop\nimprovements?\n12.1.2 CROP PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT\nIn India, as in many other agriculture-based\ncountries, farming ranges from small to very\nlarge farms. Different farmers thus have more\nor less land, money and access to information\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\nup different farming practices and agricultural\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\ncropping system and production practices.\nTherefore, production practices can be at\ndifferent levels. They include ‘no cost’\nproduction, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high\ncost’ production practices.\n12.1.2 (i) NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\nJust as we need food for development, growth\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\nby air, water and soil. There are several\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\nfrom water, and soil supplies the other thirteen\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\ncalled macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are\nused by plants in small quantities and are\ntherefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\nour environment from excessive use of\nfertilizers. Using biological waste material is\nalso a way of recycling farm waste. Based on\nthe kind of biological material used, manure\ncan be classified as:\n(i)\nCompost and vermi-compost: The\nprocess in which farm waste material\nlike livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.),\nvegetable waste, animal refuse,\ndomestic waste, sewage waste, straw,\neradicated weeds etc. is decomposed\nin pits is known as composting. The\ncompost is rich in organic matter and\nnutrients. Compost is also prepared\nby using earthworms to hasten the\nprocess of decomposition of plant and\nanimal refuse. This is called\nvermi-compost.\n(ii) Green manure: Prior to the sowing of\nthe crop seeds, some plants like sun\nhemp or guar are grown and then\nmulched by ploughing them into the\nsoil. These green plants thus turn into\ngreen manure which helps in\nenriching the soil in nitrogen\nand phosphorus.\nFERTILIZERS\nFertilizers are commercially produced plant\nnutrients. Fertilizers supply nitrogen,\nphosphorus and potassium. They are used\nto ensure good vegetative growth (leaves,\nbranches and flowers), giving rise to healthy\nplants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher\nyields of high-cost farming.\nFertilizers should be applied carefully in\nterms of proper dose, time, and observing pre-\nand post-application precautions for their\ncomplete utilisation. For example, sometimes\nfertilizers get washed away due to excessive\nirrigation and are not fully absorbed by the\nplants. This excess fertilizer then leads to\nwater pollution.\nAlso, as we have seen in the previous class,\ncontinuous use of fertilizers in an area can\ndestroy soil fertility because the organic\nmatter in the soil is not replenished and\nmicro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the\nfertilizers used. Short-term benefits of using\nfertilizers and long-term benefits of using\nDeficiency of these nutrients affects\nphysiological processes in plants including\nreproduction, growth and susceptibility to\ndiseases. To increase the yield, the soil can be\nenriched by supplying these nutrients in the\nform of manure and fertilizers.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat are macro-nutrients and\nwhy are they called macro-\nnutrients?\n2.\nHow do plants get nutrients?\nMANURE\nManure contains large quantities of organic\nmatter and also supplies small quantities of\nnutrients to the soil. Manure is prepared by\nthe decomposition of animal excreta and plant\nwaste. Manure helps in enriching soil with\nnutrients and organic matter and increasing\nsoil fertility. The bulk of organic matter in\nmanure helps in improving the soil structure.\nThis involves increasing the water holding\ncapacity in sandy soils. In clayey soils, the\nlarge quantities of organic matter help in\ndrainage and in avoiding water logging.\nIn using manure we use biological waste\nmaterial, which is advantageous in protecting\nTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nby air, water and soil\nby air, water and soil\nby air, water and soil\nby air, water and soil\nby air, water and soil\nAir\ncarbon, oxygen\nWater\nhydrogen, oxygen\nSoil\n(i) Macronutrients:\nnitrogen, phosphorus,\npotassium, calcium,\nmagnesium, sulphur\n(ii) Micronutrients:\niron, manganese, boron,\nzinc, \ncopper,\nmolybdenum, chlorine\nQ\nSource\nSource\nSource\nSource\nSource\nNutrients\nNutrients\nNutrients\nNutrients\nNutrients\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nIndia has a wide variety of water resources\nand a highly varied climate. Under such\nconditions, several different kinds of irrigation\nsystems are adopted to supply water to\nagricultural lands depending on the kinds of\nwater resources available. These include wells,\ncanals, rivers and tanks.\n•\nWells: There are two types of wells,\nnamely dug wells and tube wells. In a\ndug well, water is collected from water\nbearing strata. Tube wells can tap\nwater from the deeper strata. From\nthese wells, water is lifted by pumps\nfor irrigation.\n•\nCanals: This is usually an elaborate\nand extensive irrigation system. In this\nsystem canals receive water from one\nor more reservoirs or from rivers. The\nmain canal is divided into branch\ncanals having further distributaries to\nirrigate fields.\n•\nRiver Lift Systems: In areas where\ncanal flow is insufficient or irregular\ndue to inadequate reservoir release,\nthe lift system is more rational. Water\nis directly drawn from the rivers for\nsupplementing irrigation in areas\nclose to rivers.\n•\nTanks: These are small storage\nreservoirs, which intercept and store\nthe run-off of smaller catchment\nareas.\nFresh initiatives for increasing the water\navailable for agriculture include rainwater\nharvesting and watershed management. This\ninvolves building small check-dams which\nlead to an increase in ground water levels.\nThe check-dams stop the rainwater from\nflowing away and also reduce soil erosion.\n12.1.2 (iii) CROPPING PATTERNS\nDifferent ways of growing crops can be used\nto give maximum benefit.\nMixed cropping is growing two or more\ncrops simultaneously on the same piece of\nland, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat +\nmustard, or groundnut + sunflower. This\nreduces risk and gives some insurance\nagainst failure of one of the crops.\nmanure for maintaining soil fertility have to\nbe considered while aiming for optimum yields\nin crop production.\nuestion\n1.\nCompare the use of manure and\nfertilizers in maintaining soil\nfertility.\nOrganic farming is a farming system with\nminimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers,\nherbicides, pesticides, etc., and with a\nmaximum input of organic manures, recycled\nfarm-wastes (straw and livestock excreta), use\nof bio-agents such as culture of blue green\nalgae in preparation of biofertilizers, neem\nleaves or turmeric specifically in grain storage\nas bio-pesticides, with healthy cropping\nsystems [mixed cropping, inter-cropping and\ncrop rotation as discussed below in 12.1.2.(iii)].\nThese cropping systems are beneficial in\ninsect, pest and wheat control besides\nproviding nutrients.\n12.1.2 (ii) IRRIGATION\nMost agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is,\nthe success of crops in most areas is\ndependent on timely monsoons and sufficient\nrainfall spread through most of the growing\nseason. Hence, poor monsoons cause crop\nfailure. Ensuring that the crops get water at\nthe right stages during their growing season\ncan increase the expected yields of any crop.\nTherefore, many measures are used to bring\nmore \nand \nmore \nagricultural \nland\nunder irrigation.\nQ\nMore to know\nDroughts occur because of scarcity or\nirregular distribution of rains. Drought\nposes a threat to rain-fed farming\nareas, where farmers do not use\nirrigation for crop production and\ndepend only on rain. Light soils have\nless water retention capacity. In areas\nwith light soils, crops get adversely\naffected by drought conditions.\nScientists have developed some crop\nvarieties which can tolerate drought\nconditions.\nReprint 2025-26 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-cropping is growing two or more\ncrops simultaneously on the same field in a\ndefinite pattern (Fig.12.2). A few rows of one\ncrop alternate with a few rows of a second\ncrop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger\nmillet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia). The crops are\nselected such that their nutrient\nrequirements are different. This ensures\nmaximum utilisation of the nutrients\nsupplied, and also prevents pests and\ndiseases from spreading to all the plants\nbelonging to one crop in a field. This way,\nboth crops can give better returns.\n(gokhroo), Parthenium (gajar ghas), Cyperus\nrotundus (motha). They compete for food,\nspace and light. Weeds take up nutrients and\nreduce the growth of the crop. Therefore,\nremoval of weeds from cultivated fields during\nthe early stages of crop growth is essential for\na good harvest.\nGenerally insect pests attack the plants\nin three ways: (i) they cut the root, stem and\nleaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various\nparts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem\nand fruits. They thus affect the health of the\ncrop and reduce yields.\nDiseases in plants are caused by\npathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses.\nThese pathogens can be present in and\ntransmitted through the soil, water and air.\nWeeds, insects and diseases can be\ncontrolled by various methods. One of the\nmost commonly used methods is the use of\npesticides, which include herbicides,\ninsecticides and fungicides. These chemicals\nare sprayed on crop plants or used for treating\nseeds and soil. However, excessive use of\nthese chemicals creates problems, since they\ncan be poisonous to many plant and animal\nspecies and cause environmental pollution.\nWeed control methods also include\nmechanical removal. Preventive methods\nsuch as proper seed bed preparation, timely\nsowing of crops, intercropping and crop\nrotation also help in weed control. Some other\npreventive measures against pests are the use\nof resistant varieties, and summer ploughing,\nin which fields are ploughed deep in summers\nto destroy weeds and pests.\nuestion\n1.\nWhich of the following conditions\nwill give the most benefits? Why?\n(a)\nFarmers use high-quality\nseeds, do not adopt\nirrigation or use fertilizers.\n(b)\nFarmers use ordinary\nseeds, adopt irrigation and\nuse fertilizer.\n(c)\nFarmers use quality seeds,\nadopt irrigation, use\nfertilizer and use crop\nprotection measures.\nQ\nFig. 12.2 :\nFig. 12.2 :\nFig. 12.2 :\nFig. 12.2 :\nFig. 12.2 : Intercropping\nThe growing of different crops on a piece\nof land in a pre-planned succession is known\nas crop rotation. Depending upon the\nduration, crop rotation is done for different\ncrop combinations. The availability of moisture\nand irrigation facilities decide the choice of the\ncrop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop\nrotation is done properly then two or three\ncrops can be grown in a year with\ngood harvests.\n12.1.3 CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT\nField crops are infested by a large number of\nweeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and\npests are not controlled at the appropriate\ntime then they can damage the crops so much\nthat most of the crop is lost.\nWeeds are unwanted plants in the\ncultivated field, for example, Xanthium\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nActivity _____________12.1\n•\nVisit a nearby garden/agricultural\nfield and make a list of the weeds and\nthe flowers/crops found in the area.\nAlso, make a list of insect pests, if\nany, infesting the flowers/crops.\nSTORAGE OF GRAINS\nStorage losses in agricultural produce can be\nvery high. Factors responsible for such losses\nare biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and\nbacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture\nand temperatures in the place of storage. These\nfactors cause degradation in quality, loss in\nweight, poor germinability, discolouration of\nproduce, all leading to poor marketability.\nThese factors can be controlled by proper\ntreatment and by systematic management of\nwarehouses.\nPreventive and control measures are used\nbefore grains are stored for future use. They\ninclude strict cleaning of the produce before\nstorage, proper drying of the produce first in\nsunlight and then in shade, and fumigation\nusing chemicals that can kill pests.\nuestions\n1.\nWhy should preventive measures\nand biological control methods be\npreferred for protecting crops?\n2.\nWhat factors may be responsible\nfor losses of grains during\nstorage?\nActivity _____________12.2\n•\nCollect grains/seeds of cereals,\npulses and oil seeds and gather\ninformation about the seasons in\nwhich they are sown and harvested.\n12.2 Animal Husbandry\nAnimal husbandry is the scientific\nmanagement of animal livestock. It includes\nvarious aspects such as feeding, breeding and\ndisease control. Animal-based farming\nincludes cattle, goat, sheep, poultry and fish\nfarming. As the population increases and as\nliving standards increase, the demand for\nmilk, eggs and meat is also going up. Also,\nthe growing awareness of the need for\nhumane treatment of livestock has brought\nin new limitations in livestock farming. Thus,\nlivestock production also needs to be improved.\n12.2.1 CATTLE FARMING\nCattle husbandry is done for two purposes—\nmilk and draught labour for agricultural work\nsuch as tilling, irrigation and carting. Indian\ncattle belong to two different species, Bos\nindicus, cows, and Bos bubalis, buffaloes.\nMilk-producing females are called milch\nanimals (dairy animals), while the ones used\nfor farm labour are called draught animals.\nMilk production depends, to some extent,\non the duration of the lactation period,\nmeaning the period of milk production after\nQ\nTable 12.2: Nutritional values of animal products\nAnimal\nProducts\nFat\nProtein\nSugar\nMinerals\nWater\nVitamins\nMilk (Cow)\n3.60\n4.00\n4.50\n0.70\n87.20\nB1, B2, B12, D, E\nEgg\n12.00\n13.00\n*\n1.00\n74.00\nB2, D\nMeat\n3.60\n21.10\n*\n1.10\n74.20\nB2, B12\nFish\n2.50\n19.00\n*\n1.30\n77.20\nNiacin, D, A\n*Present in very small amounts\nPer cent (%) Nutrients\nReprint 2025-26 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES\n\nthe birth of a calf. So, milk production can be\nincreased by increasing the lactation period.\nExotic or foreign breeds (for example, Jersey,\nBrown Swiss) are selected for long lactation\nperiods, while local breeds (for example, Red\nSindhi, Sahiwal) show excellent resistance to\ndiseases. The two can be cross-bred to get\nanimals with both the desired qualities.\nuestion\n1.\nWhich method is commonly used\nfor improving cattle breeds and\nwhy?\nActivity _____________12.3\n•\nVisit a livestock farm. Note the\nfollowing:\n(1) Number of cattle and number of\ndifferent breeds.\n(2) The amount of daily milk production\nfrom the different breeds.\nProper cleaning and shelter facilities for\ncows and buffaloes are required for humane\nfarming, for the health of the animals and\nfor production of clean milk as well. Animals\nrequire regular brushing to remove dirt and\nloose hair. They should be sheltered under\nwell-ventilated roofed sheds that protect them\nfrom rain, heat and cold. The floor of the cattle\nshed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry\nand to facilitate cleaning.\nThe food requirements of dairy animals\nare of two types: (a) maintenance\nrequirement, which is the food required to\nsupport the animal to live a healthy life, and\n(b) milk producing requirement, which is the\ntype of food required during the lactation\nperiod. Animal feed includes: (a) roughage,\nwhich is largely fibre, and (b) concentrates,\nwhich are low in fibre and contain relatively\nhigh levels of proteins and other nutrients.\nCattle need balanced rations containing all\nnutrients in proportionate amounts. Besides\nsuch nutritious food material, certain feed\nadditives containing micronutrients promote\nthe health and milk output of dairy animals.\nCattle suffer from a number of diseases.\nThe diseases, besides causing death, reduce\nmilk production. A healthy animal feeds\nregularly and has a normal posture. The\nparasites of cattle may be both external\nparasites and internal parasites. The external\nparasites live on the skin and mainly cause\nskin diseases. The internal parasites like\nworms, affect stomach and intestine while\nflukes damage the liver. Infectious diseases\nare also caused by bacteria and viruses.\nVaccinations are given to farm animals\nagainst many major viral and bacterial\ndiseases.\n12.2.2 POULTRY FARMING\nPoultry farming is undertaken to raise\ndomestic fowl for egg production and chicken\nmeat. Therefore, improved poultry breeds are\ndeveloped and farmed to produce layers for\neggs and broilers for meat.\nThe cross-breeding programmes between\nIndian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and\nforeign (exotic, for example, Leghorn) breeds\nfor variety improvement are focused on to\ndevelop new varieties for the following\ndesirable traits—\n(i)\nnumber and quality of chicks;\nQ\nFig. 12.3: Indigenous milch breed of cattle\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n(ii)\ndwarf broiler parent for commercial\nchick production;\n(iii)\nsummer adaptation capacity/\ntolerance to high temperature;\n(iv)\nlow maintenance requirements;\n(v)\nreduction in the size of the egg-laying\nbird with ability to utilise more\nfibrous cheaper diets formulated\nusing agricultural by-products.\nThe ration (daily food requirement) for broilers\nis protein rich with adequate fat. The level of\nvitamins A and K is kept high in the poultry\nfeeds.\nPoultry fowl suffer from a number of\ndiseases caused by virus, bacteria, fungi,\nparasites, as well as from nutritional\ndeficiencies. These necessitate proper\ncleaning, sanitation, and spraying of\ndisinfectants at regular intervals. Appropriate\nvaccination can prevent the occurrence of\ninfectious diseases and reduce loss of poultry\nduring an outbreak of disease.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat management practices are\ncommon in dairy and poultry\nfarming?\n2.\nWhat are the differences between\nbroilers and layers and in their\nmanagement?\nActivity _____________12.4\n•\nVisit a local poultry farm. Observe\ntypes of breeds and note the type of\nration, housing and lighting facilities\ngiven to them. Identify the growers,\nlayers and broilers.\n12.2.3 FISH PRODUCTION\nFish is a cheap source of animal protein for\nour food. Fish production includes the finned\ntrue fish as well as shellfish such as prawns\nand molluscs. There are two ways of obtaining\nfish. One is from natural resources, which is\ncalled capture fishing. The other way is by\nfish farming, which is called culture fishery.\nThe water source of the fish can be either\nseawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and\nponds. Fishing can thus be done both by\ncapture and culture of fish in marine and\nfreshwater ecosystems.\n12.2.3 (i) MARINE FISHERIES\nIndia’s marine fishery resources include\n7500 km of coastline and the deep seas\nFig. 12.4\nAseel\nLeghorn\nuestion\n1.\nDiscuss the implications of the\nfollowing statement:\n“It is interesting to note that\npoultry is India’s most efficient\nconverter of low fibre food stuff\n(which is unfit for human\nconsumption) into highly\nnutritious animal protein food.”\nEGG AND BROILER PRODUCTION\nBroiler chickens are fed with vitamin-rich\nsupplementary feed for good growth rate and\nbetter feed efficiency. Care is taken to avoid\nmortality and to maintain feathering and\ncarcass quality. They are produced as broilers\nand sent to market for meat purposes.\nFor good production of poultry birds, good\nmanagement practices are important. These\ninclude maintenance of temperature and\nhygienic conditions in housing and poultry\nfeed, as well as prevention and control of\ndiseases and pests.\nThe \nhousing, \nnutritional \nand\nenvironmental requirements of broilers are\nsomewhat different from those of egg layers.\nQ\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES\n\nbeyond it. Popular marine fish varieties\ninclude pomphret, mackerel, tuna, sardines,\nand Bombay duck. Marine fish are caught\nusing many kinds of fishing nets from fishing\nboats. Yields are increased by locating large\nschools of fish in the open sea using satellites\nand echo-sounders.\nSome marine fish of high economic value\nare also farmed in seawater. This includes\nfinned fishes like mullets, bhetki, and pearl\nspots, shellfish such as prawns (Fig. 12.5),\nmussels and oysters as well as seaweed.\nOysters are also cultivated for the pearls\nthey make.\nMacrobrachium rosenbergii\n(fresh water)\nPeneaus monodon\n(marine)\nFig. 12.5 : Fresh water and marine prawns\nAs marine fish stocks get further depleted,\nthe demand for more fish can only be met by\nsuch culture fisheries, a practice called\nmariculture.\n12.2.3 (ii) INLAND FISHERIES\nFresh water resources include canals, ponds,\nreservoirs and rivers. Brackish water\nresources, where seawater and fresh water\nmix together, such as estuaries and lagoons\nare also important fish reservoirs. While\ncapture fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction from these resources is through\naquaculture.\nFish culture is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice crop, so that fish are\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. More\nintensive fish farming can be done in\ncomposite fish culture systems. Both local\nand imported fish species are used in such\nsystems.\nIn such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\nThese species are selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a result, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps are bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other. This\nincreases the fish yield from the pond.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp (c) Rohu (d) Grass\nCarp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp\n(e)\n(f)\nOne problem with such composite fish\nculture is that many of these fish breed only\nduring monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected\nfrom the wild, it can be mixed with that of\nother species as well. So, a major problem in\nfish farming is the lack of availability of good-\nquality seed. To overcome this problem, ways\nhave now been worked out to breed these fish\nin ponds using hormonal stimulation. This\nhas ensured the supply of pure fish seed in\ndesired quantities.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nuestions\n1.\nHow are fish obtained?\n2.\nWhat are the advantages of\ncomposite fish culture?\nActivity _____________12.5\n•\nVisit a fish farm in fish breeding\nseason and note the following:\n(1) Varieties of fish in fish farm\n(2) Types of ponds\n(3) Feed ingredients used\n(4) Production capacity of the farm\nIf there are no fish farms close to your\nlocality, gather the above information from\nInternet, by referring books or talking to\npeople who are engaged in fishery.\n12.2.4 BEE-KEEPING\nHoney is widely used and therefore bee-\nkeeping for making honey has become an\nagricultural enterprise. Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, farmers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives are a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations.\nThe local varieties of bees used for\ncommercial honey production are Apis cerana\nindica, commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata, the rock bee and A. florae, the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey.\nThis is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production.\nThe Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established.\nThe value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection.\nIn addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will determine\nthe taste of the honey.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat \nare \nthe \ndesirable\ncharacters of bee varieties\nsuitable for honey production?\n2.\nWhat is pasturage and how is it\nrelated to honey production?\nQ\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 12.7: (a) Arrangement of beehive in an apiary\n(b) honey extractor\nQ\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nThere are several nutrients essential for crops.
