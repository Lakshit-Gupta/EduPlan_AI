        "From these activities, can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together, they become electrically charged? Where does this charge come from? This question can be answered by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of charged particles. Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was indivisible particle but contained at least one sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations  in a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one. It seemed that an atom was composed of protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom, for whereas electrons could easily be removed off but not protons. Now the big question was: what sort of structure did  these particles of the atom form? We will find the answer to this question below."

        "We have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible. But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom.",
        "4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM",
        "Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We can also think of a watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).",
        "Thomson proposed that: (i) An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it. (ii) The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we will see below.",
        "4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM",
        "Ernest Rutherford was interested in knowing how the electrons are arranged within an atom. Rutherford designed an experiment for this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha (α)-particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil. • He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick. • α-particles are doubly-charged helium ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the fast-moving  α-particles  have  a considerable amount of energy. • It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the sub-atomic particles in the gold atoms. Since the α-particles were much heavier than the protons, he did not expect to see large deflections."

He directed the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge for 35 years and seven of his research assistants subsequently won Nobel prizes.",

        "Fig. 4.2: Scattering of α-particles by a gold foil",
        "But, the α-particle scattering experiment gave totally unexpected results (Fig. 4.2).  The following observations were made: (i) Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight through the gold foil. (ii) Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles. (iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appeared to rebound. In the words of Rutherford, “This result was almost as incredible as if you fire a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it comes back and hits you”.",
        "He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment that— (i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected. (ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space. (iii) A very small fraction of α-particles were deflected by 1800, indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom. From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features: (i) There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus. (ii) The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths. (iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom.",
        "Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of the atom",
        "The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know. We know that atoms are quite stable.",
        "E. Rutherford (1871–1937) was born at Spring Grove on 30 August 1871. He was known as the ‘Father’ of nuclear physics.  He is famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of the nucleus of an atom with the gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1908.",

The combining capacity of the atoms of elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet. Atoms would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell. This was done by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. The number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of the",

It is two and three, respectively, because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell.

  "full_text": "In Chapter 3, we have learnt that atoms and\nmolecules are the fundamental building\nblocks of matter. The existence of different\nkinds of matter is due to different atoms\nconstituting them. Now the questions arise:\n(i) What makes the atom of one element\ndifferent from the atom of another element?\nand (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as\nproposed by Dalton, or are there smaller\nconstituents inside the atom? We shall find\nout the answers to these questions in this\nchapter. We will learn about sub-atomic\nparticles and the various models that have\nbeen proposed to explain how these particles\nare arranged within the atom.\nA major challenge before the scientists at\nthe end of the 19th century was to reveal the\nstructure of the atom as well as to explain its\nimportant properties. The elucidation of the\nstructure of atoms is based on a series of\nexperiments.\nOne of the first indications that atoms are\nnot indivisible, comes from studying static\nelectricity and the condition under which\nelectricity is conducted by different\nsubstances.\n4.1 Charged Particles in Matter\nFor understanding the nature of charged\nparticles in matter, let us carry out the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 4.1\nA.\nComb dry hair. Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper?\nB.\nRub a glass rod with a silk cloth and\nbring the rod near an inflated balloon.\nObserve what happens.\nFrom these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together, they\nbecome electrically charged? Where does this\ncharge come from? This question can be\nanswered by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of charged particles.\nMany scientists contributed in revealing\nthe presence of charged particles in an atom.\nIt was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle – the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The\nmass of a proton is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.\nIt seemed that an atom was composed of\nprotons and electrons, mutually balancing\ntheir charges. It also appeared that the protons\nwere in the interior of the atom, for whereas\nelectrons could easily be removed off but\nnot protons. Now the big question was:\nwhat sort of structure did these particles of\nthe atom form? We will find the answer to\nthis question below.\n\nSTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE A\n A\n A\n A\n ATOM\nTOM\nTOM\nTOM\nTOM\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 uestions\n1.\nWhat are canal rays?\n2.\nIf an atom contains one electron\nand one proton, will it carry any\ncharge or not?\n4.2 The Structure of an Atom\nWe have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in\nChapter 3, which suggested that the atom\nwas indivisible and indestructible. But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led\nto the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic\ntheory. It was then considered necessary to\nknow how electrons and protons are arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists proposed various atomic models.\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. We can also think of a\nwatermelon, the positive charge in the atom\nis spread all over like the red edible part of\nthe watermelon, while the electrons are\nstudded in the positively charged sphere, like\nthe seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).\nThomson proposed that:\n(i)\nAn atom consists of a positively\ncharged sphere and the electrons are\nembedded in it.\n(ii)\nThe negative and positive charges are\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral.\nAlthough Thomson’s model explained that\natoms are electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below.\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nErnest Rutherford was interested in knowing\nhow the electrons are arranged within an\natom. Rutherford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(α)-particles were made to fall on a thin\ngold foil.\n•\nHe selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick.\n•\nα-particles are doubly-charged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving \nα-particles \nhave \na\nconsiderable amount of energy.\n•\nIt was expected that α-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the α-particles were\nmuch heavier than the protons, he did\nnot expect to see large deflections.\nQ\nFig.4.1: Thomson’s model of an atom\nJ.J. Thomson (1856–\n1940), \n \na \nBritish\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof \nManchester, \non\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons. He\ndirected the Cavendish Laboratory at\nCambridge for 35 years and seven of his\nresearch assistants subsequently won\nNobel prizes.\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nFig. 4.2: Scattering of α-particles by a gold foil\nBut, the α-particle scattering experiment\ngave totally unexpected results (Fig. 4.2). The\nfollowing observations were made:\n(i)\nMost of the fast moving α-particles\npassed straight through the gold foil.\n(ii)\nSome of the α-particles were deflected\nby the foil by small angles.\n(iii)\nSurprisingly one out of every 12000\nparticles appeared to rebound.\nIn the words of Rutherford, “This result\nwas almost as incredible as if you fire a\n15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it\ncomes back and hits you”.\nHe will hear a sound when each stone strikes\nthe wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will\nhear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded\nchild were to throw stones at a barbed-wire\nfence, most of the stones would not hit the\nfencing and no sound would be heard. This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them.\nFollowing a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded from the α-particle scattering\nexperiment that—\n(i)\nMost of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the α-particles\npassed through the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.\n(ii)\nVery few particles were deflected from\ntheir path, indicating that the positive\ncharge of the atom occupies very little\nspace.\n(iii)\nA very small fraction of α-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive charge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom.\nFrom the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom.\nOn the basis of his experiment,\nRutherford put forward the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following features:\n(i)\nThere is a positively charged centre in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom resides in the\nnucleus.\n(ii)\nThe electrons revolve around the\nnucleus in circular paths.\n(iii)\nThe size of the nucleus is very small\nas compared to the size of the atom.\nDrawbacks of Rutherford’s model of\nthe atom\nThe revolution of the electron in a circular orbit\nis not expected to be stable. Any particle in a\ncircular orbit would undergo acceleration.\nDuring acceleration, charged particles would\nradiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron\nwould lose energy and finally fall into the\nnucleus. If this were so, the atom should be\nhighly unstable and hence matter would not\nexist in the form that we know. We know that\natoms are quite stable.\nE. Rutherford (1871–1937)\nwas born at Spring Grove\non 30 August 1871. He was\nknown as the ‘Father’ of\nnuclear physics. He is\nfamous for his work on\nradioactivity and the\ndiscovery of the nucleus of an atom with\nthe gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel\nprize in chemistry in 1908.\nLet us think of an activity in an open field\nto understand the implications of this\nexperiment. Let a child stand in front of a\nwall with his eyes closed. Let him throw\nstones at the wall from a distance.\nReprint 2025-26 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n\n4.2.3 BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOM\nIn order to overcome the objections raised\nagainst Rutherford’s model of the atom,\nNeils Bohr put forward the following\npostulates about the model of an atom:\n(i)\nOnly certain special orbits known as\ndiscrete orbits of electrons, are allowed\ninside the atom.\n(ii)\nWhile revolving in discrete orbits the\nelectrons do not radiate energy.\nuestions\n1.\nOn the basis of Thomson’s model\nof an atom, explain how the atom\nis neutral as a whole.\n2.\nOn the basis of Rutherford’s\nmodel of an atom, which sub-\natomic particle is present in the\nnucleus of an atom?\n3.\nDraw a sketch of Bohr’s model\nof an atom with three shells.\n4.\nWhat do you think would be the\nobservation if the α-particle\nscattering experiment is carried\nout using a foil of a metal other\nthan gold?\n4.2.4 NEUTRONS\nIn 1932, J. Chadwick discovered another sub-\natomic particle which had no charge and a\nmass nearly equal to that of a proton. It was\neventually named as neutron. Neutrons are\npresent in the nucleus of all atoms, except\nhydrogen. In general, a neutron is\nrepresented as ‘n’. The mass of an atom is\ntherefore given by the sum of the masses of\nprotons and neutrons present in the nucleus.\nuestions\n1.\nName the three sub-atomic\nparticles of an atom.\n2.\nHelium atom has an atomic mass\nof 4 u and two protons in its\nnucleus. How many neutrons\ndoes it have?\n4.3 How are Electrons Distributed\nin Different Orbits (Shells)?\nThe distribution of electrons into different\norbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr\nand Bury.\nThe following rules are followed for writing\nthe number of electrons in different energy\nlevels or shells:\n(i)\nThe maximum number of electrons\npresent in a shell is given by the\nNeils Bohr (1885–1962)\nwas born in Copenhagen\non 7 October 1885. He was\nappointed professor of\nphysics at Copenhagen\nUniversity in 1916. He got\nthe Nobel prize for his work\non the structure of atom in\n1922. Among Professor\nBohr’s numerous writings, three appearing\nas books are:\n(i) The Theory of Spectra and Atomic\nConstitution, (ii) Atomic Theory and,\n(iii) The Description of Nature.\nThese orbits or shells are called energy\nlevels. Energy levels in an atom are shown in\nFig. 4.3.\nQ\nFig. 4.3: A few energy levels in an atom\nThese orbits or shells are represented by\nthe letters K,L,M,N,… or the numbers,\nn=1,2,3,4,….\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nformula 2n2, where ‘n’ is the orbit\nnumber or energy level index, 1,2,3,….\nHence the maximum number of\nelectrons in different shells are as\nfollows:\nfirst orbit or K-shell will be = 2 × 12 = 2,\nsecond orbit or L-shell will be = 2 × 22 = 8,\nthird orbit or M-shell will be = 2 × 32 = 18,\nfourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2 × 42\n= 32, and so on.\n(ii)\nThe maximum number of electrons that\ncan be accommodated in the outermost\norbit is 8.\n(iii)\nElectrons are not accommodated in a\ngiven shell, unless the inner shells are\nfilled. That is, the shells are filled in a\nstep-wise manner.\nAtomic structure of the first eighteen\nelements is shown schematically in Fig. 4.4.\n•\nThe composition of atoms of the first\neighteen elements is given in Table 4.1.\nuestions\n1.\nWrite the distribution of electrons\nin carbon and sodium atoms.\n2.\nIf K and L shells of an atom are\nfull, then what would be the total\nnumber of electrons in the atom?\n4.4 Valency\nWe have learnt how the electrons in an atom\nare arranged in different shells/orbits. The\nelectrons present in the outermost shell of\nan atom are known as the valence electrons.\nFrom the Bohr-Bury scheme, we also know\nthat the outermost shell of an atom can\nActivity ______________ 4.2\n•\nMake a static atomic model displaying\nelectronic configuration of the first\neighteen elements.\nFig.4.4: Schematic atomic structure of the first eighteen elements\nQ\naccommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It\nwas observed that the atoms of elements,\ncompletely filled with 8 electrons in the\noutermost shell show little chemical activity.\nIn other words, their combining capacity or\nvalency is zero. Of these inert elements, the\nReprint 2025-26 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n\nTable 4.1: Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements\nwith Electron Distribution in Various Shells\nhelium atom has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and all other elements have atoms with\neight electrons in the outermost shell.\nThe combining capacity of the atoms of\nelements, that is, their tendency to react and\nform molecules with atoms of the same or\ndifferent elements, was thus explained as an\nattempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.\nAn outermost-shell, which had eight electrons\nwas said to possess an octet. Atoms would\nthus react, so as to achieve an octet in the\noutermost shell. This was done by sharing,\ngaining or losing electrons. The number of\nelectrons gained, lost or shared so as to make\nthe octet of electrons in the outermost shell,\ngives us directly the combining capacity of the\nelement, that is, the valency discussed in the\nprevious chapter. For example, hydrogen/\nlithium/sodium atoms contain one electron\neach in their outermost shell, therefore each\none of them can lose one electron. So, they are\nsaid to have valency of one. Can you tell, what\nis valency of magnesium and aluminium? It\nis two and three, respectively, because\nmagnesium has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and aluminium has three electrons in\nits outermost shell.\nIf the number of electrons in the\noutermost shell of an atom is close to its full\ncapacity, then valency is determined in a\ndifferent way. For example, the fluorine atom\nhas 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its\nvalency could be 7.

Hence, its valency is determined\nby subtracting seven electrons from the octet\nand this gives you a valency of one for fluorine.\nValency can be calculated in a similar manner\nfor oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that\nyou get from this calculation?\nTherefore, an atom of each element has a\ndefinite combining capacity, called its valency.\nValency of the first eighteen elements is given\nin the last column of Table 4.1.\nuestion\n1.\nHow will you find the valency\nof chlorine, sulphur and\nmagnesium?\n4.5 Atomic Number and Mass\nNumber\n4.5.1 ATOMIC NUMBER\nWe know that protons are present in the\nnucleus of an atom. It is the number of\nprotons of an atom, which determines its\natomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms\nof an element have the same atomic number,\nZ. In fact, elements are defined by the number\nof protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,\nbecause in hydrogen atom, only one proton\nis present in the nucleus. Similarly, for\ncarbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number\nis defined as the total number of protons\npresent in the nucleus of an atom.\n4.5.2 MASS NUMBER\nAfter studying the properties of the sub-\natomic particles of an atom, we can conclude\nthat mass of an atom is practically due to\nprotons and neutrons alone. These are\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. Hence\nprotons and neutrons are also called\nnucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom\nresides in its nucleus. For example, mass of\ncarbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and\n6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the\nmass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14\nneutrons). The mass number is defined as the\nsum of the total number of protons and\nneutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It\nis denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom,\nthe atomic number, mass number and symbol\nof the element are to be written as:\nMass Number\nQ\nSymbol of\nelement\nAtomic Number\nFor example, nitrogen is written as 14\n7 N .\nuestions\n1.\nIf number of electrons in an atom\nis 8 and number of protons is also\n8, then (i) what is the atomic\nnumber of the atom? and (ii) what\nis the charge on the atom?\n2.\nWith the help of Table 4.1, find\nout the mass number of oxygen\nand sulphur atom.\n4.6 Isotopes\nIn nature, a number of atoms of some\nelements have been identified, which have the\nsame atomic number but different mass\nnumbers. For example, take the case of\nhydrogen atom, it has three atomic species,\nnamely protium (1\n1H), deuterium ( 2\n1 H or D)\nand tritium ( 3\n1H or T). The atomic number of\neach one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2\nand 3, respectively. Other such examples are\n(i) carbon, \n\n6 C and \n\n6 C, (ii) chlorine, 35\n17 Cl\nand 37\n17 Cl, etc.\nOn the basis of these examples, isotopes\nare defined as the atoms of the same element,\nhaving the same atomic number but different\nmass numbers. Therefore, we can say that\nthere are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,\nnamely protium, deuterium and tritium.\nQ\nX\nA\nZ\nReprint 2025-26 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n\nQ\nMany elements consist of a mixture of\nisotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure\nsubstance. The chemical properties of\nisotopes are similar but their physical\nproperties are different.\nChlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic\nforms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio\nof 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what\nshould we take as the mass of chlorine atom?\nLet us find out.\nThe average atomic mass of chlorine atom,\non the basis of above data, will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n+\n×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= \n\n\n\n\n\n+\n=\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35 5\n. u\nThe mass of an atom of any natural element\nis taken as the average mass of all the naturally\noccuring atoms of that element. If an element\nhas no isotopes, then the mass of its atom\nwould be the same as the sum of protons and\nneutrons in it. But if an element occurs in\nisotopic forms, then we have to know the\npercentage of each isotopic form and then the\naverage mass is calculated.\nThis does not mean that any one atom of\nchlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It\nmeans that if you take a certain amount of\nchlorine, it will contain both isotopes of\nchlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.\nApplications\nSince the chemical properties of all the\nisotopes of an element are the same,\nnormally we are not concerned about\ntaking a mixture. But some isotopes have\nspecial properties which find them useful\nin various fields. Some of them are :\n(i)\nAn isotope of uranium is used as a fuel\nin nuclear reactors.\n(ii)\nAn isotope of cobalt is used in the\ntreatment of cancer.\n(iii)\nAn isotope of iodine is used in the\ntreatment of goitre.\n4.6.1 ISOBARS\nLet us consider two elements — calcium,\natomic number 20, and argon, atomic\nnumber 18. The number of protons in these\natoms is different, but the mass number of\nboth these elements is 40. That is, the total\nnumber of nucleons is the same in the atoms\nof this pair of elements. Atoms of different\nelements with different atomic numbers, which\nhave the same mass number, are known as\nisobars.\nuestions\n1.\nFor the symbol H,D and T\ntabulate three sub-atomic\nparticles found in each of them.\n2.\nWrite \nthe \nelectronic\nconfiguration of any one pair of\nisotopes and isobars.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nCredit for the discovery of electron and proton goes to J.J.\nThomson and E.Goldstein, respectively.\n•\nJ.J.
