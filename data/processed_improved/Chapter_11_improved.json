        "the vibrating object to the ear. A particle of the medium in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position. It then exerts a force on the adjacent particle. As a result of which the adjacent particle gets displaced from its position of rest. After displacing the adjacent particle the first particle comes back to its original position. This process continues in the medium till the sound reaches your ear. The disturbance created by a source of  sound in the medium travels through the medium and not the particles of the medium. A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion. They in turn produce similar motion in others. The particles of the medium do not move forward themselves, but the disturbance is carried forward. This is what happens during propagation of sound in a medium, hence sound can be visualised as a wave. Sound waves are characterised by the motion of particles in the medium and are called mechanical waves. Air is the most common medium through which sound travels. When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure. This region is called a compression (C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression starts to move away from the vibrating object. When the vibrating object moves backwards, it creates a region of low pressure called rarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the object moves back and forth rapidly, a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air. These make the sound wave that",

We can also produce sound by plucking, scratching, rubbing, blowing or shaking different objects. As per the above activities what do we do to the objects? We set the objects vibrating and produce sound. Vibration means a kind of rapid to and fro motion of an object. The sound of the human voice is produced due to vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird flaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think how the buzzing sound accompanying a bee is produced. A stretched rubber band when plucked vibrates and produces sound. If you have never done this, then do it and observe the vibration of the stretched rubber band."

        "The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions (C) and the regions where the coils are further apart are called rarefactions (R). As we already know, sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions. Now, we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium. These waves are called longitudinal waves. In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest. This is exactly how a sound wave propagates, hence sound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave, called a transverse wave. In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the direction of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about their mean position as the wave travels. Thus, a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. When we drop a pebble in a pond, the waves you see on the water surface is an example of transverse wave. Light is a transverse wave but for light, the oscillations are not of the medium particles or their pressure or density— it is not a mechanical wave. You will come to know more about transverse waves in higher classes.",

The faster the vibration of the source, the higher is the frequency and the higher is the pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a high pitch sound corresponds to more number of compressions and rarefactions passing a fixed point per unit time.

        "Sound propagates through a medium at a finite speed. The sound of a thunder is heard  a little later than the flash of light is seen. So, we can make out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light. The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels. You will learn about this dependence in higher classes. The speed of sound in a medium depends on temperature of the medium. The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state. In any medium as we increase the temperature, the speed of sound increases. For example, the speed of sound in air is 331 m s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds of sound at a particular temperature in various media are listed in Table 11.1. You need not memorise the values.",

        "If we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting object such as a tall building or a mountain,we will hear the same sound again a little  later. This sound which we hear is called an echo. The sensation of sound persists in our brain for about 0.1 s. To hear a distinct echo the time interval between the original sound and the reflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we take the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a given temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the sound must go to the obstacle and reach back the ear of the listener on reflection after 0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by the sound from the point of generation to the reflecting surface and back should be at least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus, for hearing distinct echoes, the minimum distance of the obstacle from the source of sound must be half of this distance, that is, 17.2 m. This distance will change with the temperature of air. Echoes may be heard more than once due to successive or multiple reflections. The rolling of thunder is due to the successive reflections of the sound from a number of reflecting surfaces, such as the clouds and the land.",

Sounds of frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or infrasound. If we could hear infrasound we would hear the vibrations of a pendulum just as we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee. Rhinoceroses communicate using infrasound of frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range. It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes produce low-frequency infrasound before the main shock waves begin which possibly alert the animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound. Ultrasound is produced by animals such as dolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain families have very sensitive hearing equipment. These moths can hear the high frequency"

  "full_text": "Everyday we hear sounds from various\nsources like humans, birds, bells, machines,\nvehicles, televisions, radios etc. Sound is a\nform of energy which produces a sensation\nof hearing in our ears. There are also other\nforms of energy like mechanical energy, light\nenergy, etc. We have talked about mechanical\nenergy in the previous chapters. You have\nbeen taught about conservation of energy,\nwhich states that we can neither create nor\ndestroy energy. We can just change it from\none form to another. When you clap, a sound\nis produced. Can you produce sound without\nutilising your energy? Which form of energy\ndid you use to produce sound? In this\nchapter we are going to learn how sound is\nproduced and how it is transmitted through\na medium and received by our ears.\n11.1 Production of Sound\nActivity _____________11.1\n•\nTake a tuning fork and set it vibrating\nby striking its prong on a rubber pad.\nBring it near your ear.\n•\nDo you hear any sound?\n•\nTouch one of the prongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork with your finger and share\nyour experience with your friends.\n•\nNow, suspend a table tennis ball or a\nsmall plastic ball by a thread from a\nsupport [Take a big needle and a\nthread, put a knot at one end of the\nthread, and then with the help of the\nneedle pass the thread through the\nball]. Touch the ball gently with the\nprong \nof \na \nvibrating \ntuning\nfork (Fig. 11.1).\n•\nObserve what happens and discuss\nwith your friends.\nActivity _____________11.2\n•\nFill water in a beaker or a glass up to\nthe brim. Gently touch the water surface\nwith one of the prongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork, as shown in Fig. 11.2.\n•\nNext dip the prongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork in water, as shown in Fig.\n11.3.\n•\nObserve what happens in both the\ncases.\n•\nDiscuss with your friends why this\nhappens.\nFig. 11.1: Vibrating tuning fork just touching the\nsuspended table tennis ball.\nFig. 11.2: One of the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork touching the water surface.\n\nSOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nthe vibrating object to the ear. A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This process continues in the\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\ndisturbance created by a source of sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forward themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium through\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressure. This region is called a compression\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\nit creates a region of low pressure called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork dipped in water\nFrom the above activities what do you\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\na vibrating object?\nIn the above activities we have produced\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\nsound of the human voice is produced due\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\nthe vibration of the stretched rubber band.\nActivity _____________11.3\n•\nMake a list of different types of\nmusical instruments and discuss\nwith your friends which part of the\ninstrument vibrates to produce\nsound.\n11.2 Propagation of Sound\nSound is produced by vibrating objects. The\nmatter or substance through which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\nFig. 11.4:\nA vibrating object creating a series of\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\nthe medium.\nReprint 2025-26 SOUND\n\npropagates \nthrough \nthe \nmedium.\nCompression is the region of high pressure\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\nPressure is related to the number of particles\nof a medium in a given volume. More density\nof the particles in the medium gives more\npressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation\nof sound can be visualised as propagation of\ndensity variations or pressure variations in\nthe medium.\nuestion\n1.\nHow does the sound produced by\na vibrating object in a medium\nreach your ear?\n2.\nExplain how sound is produced\nby your school bell.\n3.\nWhy are sound waves called\nmechanical waves?\n4.\nSuppose you and your friend are\non the moon. Will you be able to\nhear any sound produced by\nyour friend?\n11.2.1 SOUND WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\nActivity _____________11.4\n•\nTake a slinky. Ask your friend to hold\none end. You hold the other end.\nNow stretch the slinky as shown in\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\ntowards your friend.\n•\nWhat do you notice? If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n•\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\nwave. You will come to know more about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\nWAVE\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n•\nfrequency\n•\namplitude and\n•\nspeed.\nQ\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\npressure change when the sound wave moves\nin the medium. The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure. Fig. 11.6(a) and\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 11.5: Longitudinal wave in a slinky.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nHeinrich Rudolph Hertz\nwas born on 22 February\n\nin \nHamburg,\nGermany and educated at\nthe University of Berlin. He\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell’s\nelectromagnetic theory by\nhis experiments. He laid the\nfoundation for future\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\nand even television. He also discovered the\nphotoelectric effect which was later\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour.\nFig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\nwave propagates in the medium.\nCompressions are the regions where\nparticles are crowded together and\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\nof \nmaximum \ncompression. \nThus,\ncompressions are regions where density as\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\nregions of low pressure where particles are\nspread apart and are represented by the\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\nThe distance between two consecutive\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\nusually represented by λ (Greek letter\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\nH. R. Hertz\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\ngraphically the density and pressure variations.\nFrequency tells us how frequently an\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\nyour beating the drum. We know that when\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\nReprint 2025-26 SOUND\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the brain interprets the frequency\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure.\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\nn (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\nother words, we can say that the time taken\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\nFrequency and time period are related as\nfollows:\n A violin and a flute may both be played\nat the same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source. But the sounds we receive are\ndifferent. This is due to the different\ncharacteristics associated with the sound.\nPitch is one of the characteristics.\n= 1\nv\nT\nFig. 11.7:\nFig. 11.7:\nFig. 11.7:\nFig. 11.7:\nFig. 11.7: Low pitch sound has low frequency and\nhigh pitch of sound has high frequency.\nFig. 11.8:\nFig. 11.8:\nFig. 11.8:\nFig. 11.8:\nFig. 11.8:\nSoft sound has small amplitude and\nlouder sound has large amplitude.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nQ\nQ\nuestions\n1.\nWhich wave property determines\n(a) loudness, (b) pitch?\n2.\nGuess which sound has a higher\npitch: guitar or car horn?\nThe speed of sound is defined as the\ndistance which a point on a wave, such as a\ncompression or a rarefaction, travels per unit\ntime.\nWe know,\nspeed, v = distance / time\n= λ\nT\nExample 11.1 A sound wave has a\nfrequency of 2 k Hz and wave length\n35 cm.

What is the time interval\nbetween successive compressions\nfrom the source?\nThe amount of sound energy passing each\nsecond through unit area is called the intensity\nof sound. We sometimes use the terms\n“loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably,\nbut they are not the same. Loudness is a\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\nsimply because our ear detects it better.\nof less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\nit is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8\nshows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft\nsound of the same frequency.\nThe quality or timber of sound is that\ncharacteristic which enables us to distinguish\none sound from another having the same pitch\nand loudness. The sound which is more\npleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound\nof single frequency is called a tone. The sound\nwhich is produced due to a mixture of several\nfrequencies is called a note and is pleasant to\nlisten to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music\nis pleasant to hear and is of rich quality.\nHere λ is the wavelength of the sound wave. It\nis the distance travelled by the sound wave in\none time period (T) of the wave. Thus,\nv = λ ν \nor\nv = λ ν\nThat is, speed = wavelength × frequency.\nThe speed of sound remains almost the\nsame for all frequencies in a given medium\nunder the same physical conditions.\nReprint 2025-26 SOUND\n\nuestion\n1.\nDistinguish between loudness\nand intensity of sound.\nuestion\n1.\nIn which of the three media, air,\nwater or iron, does sound travel\nthe fastest at a particular\ntemperature?\n11.3 Reflection of Sound\nSound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a\nrubber ball bounces off a wall. Like light, sound\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\nActivity _____________11.5\n•\nTake two identical pipes, as shown in\nFig. 11.9.

The length of the\npipes should be sufficiently long\nas shown.\n•\nArrange them on a table near a wall.\n•\nKeep a clock near the open end of one\nof the pipes and try to hear the sound\nof the clock through the other pipe.\n•\nAdjust the position of the pipes so\nthat you can best hear the sound of\nthe clock.\n•\nNow, measure the angles of incidence\nand \nreflection \nand \nsee \nthe\nrelationship between the angles.\n•\nLift the pipe on the right vertically\nto a small height and observe\nwhat happens.\n(In place of a clock, a mobile phone\non vibrating mode may also be used.)\nQ\nQ\n11.2.3 SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT\nMEDIA\nSound propagates through a medium at a finite\nspeed. The sound of a thunder is heard a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\nmemorise the values.\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\nState\nSubstance\nSpeed in m/s\nSolids\nAluminium\n\nNickel\n\nSteel\n\nIron\n\nBrass\n\nGlass (Flint)\n\nLiquids\nWater (Sea)\n\nWater (distilled)\n\nEthanol\n\nMethanol\n\nGases\nHydrogen\n\nHelium\n\nAir\n\nOxygen\n\nSulphur dioxide\n\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n11.3.1 ECHO\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\nobject such as a tall building or a\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\nagain a little later. This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\nis due to the successive reflections of the\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\naudible. The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\ncliff and the person\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\nQ\nHorn\nMegaphone\nFig 11.10: A megaphone and a horn.\nuestion\n1.\nAn echo is heard in 3 s. What is\nthe distance of the reflecting\nsurface from the source, given that\nthe speed of sound is 342 m s–1?\n11.3.3 USES OF MULTIPLE REFLECTION\nOF SOUND\n1.\nMegaphones or loudhailers, horns,\nmusical instruments such as trumpets\nand shehanais, are all designed to send\nsound in a particular direction without\nspreading it in all directions, as shown\nin Fig 11.10.\nReprint 2025-26 SOUND\n\n2.\nStethoscope is a medical instrument\nused for listening to sounds produced\nwithin the body, mainly in the heart or\nlungs. In stethoscopes the sound of the\npatient’s heartbeat reaches the doctor’s\nears by multiple reflection of sound, as\nshown in Fig.11.11.\nFig. 11.12: Curved ceiling of a conference hall.\nFig. 11.13: Sound board used in a big hall.\nuestion\n1.\nWhy are the ceilings of concert\nhalls curved?\n11.4 Range of Hearing\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\nup to 25 k Hz (1 k Hz = 1000 Hz). As people\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 k Hz\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\ndolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain\nfamilies have very sensitive hearing equipment.\nThese moths can hear the high frequency\nQ\nFig.11.11: Stethoscope\n3.\nGenerally the ceilings of concert halls,\nconference halls and cinema halls are\ncurved so that sound after reflection\nreaches all corners of the hall, as\nshown in Fig 11.12. Sometimes a\ncurved soundboard may be placed\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\nspreads evenly across the width of the\nhall (Fig 11.13).\nIn these instruments, a tube followed\nby a conical opening reflects sound\nsuccessively to guide most of the\nsound waves from the source in the\nforward direction towards the\naudience.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nsqueaks of the bat and know when a bat\nis flying nearby, and are able to escape\ncapture.
