      "title": "As we look at our surroundings, we see a large variety of things with different shapes, sizes and textures. Everything in this universe is made up of material which scientists have named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small drop of water or a particle of sand — every thing is matter. We can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space and have mass. In other words, they have both mass* and volume**. Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surroundings. Early Indian philosophers classified matter in the form of five basic elements — the “Panch Tatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water. According to them everything, living or non- living, was made up of these five basic elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had arrived at a similar classification of matter. Modern day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on their physical properties and chemical nature. In this chapter we shall learn about matter based on its physical properties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up in subsequent chapters. 1.1  Physical Nature of Matter",

        "1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the nature of matter. One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the nature of matter — is it continuous or particulate?"

Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises, particles move faster. So, we can say that with increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. In the above three activities we observe that particles of matter intermix on their own with each other. They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. We also observe that on heating, diffusion becomes faster.

Are you able to compress them? All the above are examples of solids. We can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force. Solids may break under force but it is difficult to change their shape, so they are rigid. Consider the following: (a) What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on stretching? Is it a solid? (b) What about sugar and salt? When kept in different jars these take the shape of the jar. Are they solid? (c) What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we are able to compress it. Why? All the above are solids as: • A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape when the force is removed. If excessive force is applied, it breaks. • The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar. • A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we press it, the air is expelled out and we are able to compress it. 1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE"

Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder from the laboratory. • What will happen if these liquids are spilt on the floor? • Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into different containers one by one. Does the volume remain the same? • Does the shape of the liquid remain the same ? • When you pour the liquid from one container into another, does it flow easily? We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into liquids. The gases from the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. All living creatures need to breathe for survival. The aquatic animals can breathe under water due to the presence of dissolved oxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is Reprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 5 higher than that of solids.  This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state. 1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling a large number of balloons from a single cylinder of gas?

You may apply some vaseline on the pistons before inserting them into the syringes for their smooth movement. • Now, try to compress the content by pushing the piston in each syringe. We have observed that gases are highly compressible as compared to solids and liquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder that we get in our home for cooking or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility, large volumes of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and transported easily. We  come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering there, by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread from the kitchen, reach us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and large space between   them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases. In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container. The pressure exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit area on the walls of the container. Fig. 1.4 • What do you observe?

On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing the",
        "state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperature, it is considered that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The word latent means hidden. The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat energy to water, particles start moving even faster.  At a certain temperature, a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other. At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water at the same temperature. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra energy in the form of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.",
        "So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature. We have learnt that substances around us change state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas on application of heat. But there Reprint 2025-26 SCIENCE 8 enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come closer? Do you think that increasing or decreasing the pressure can change the state of matter? are some that change directly from solid state to gaseous state and vice versa without changing into the liquid state."

        "• Take some camphor. Crush it and put it in a china dish. • Put an inverted funnel over the china dish. • Put a cotton plug on the stem of the funnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7. * atmosphere (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas. The unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa): 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa. The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere, and is taken as the normal atmospheric pressure. Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphor Fig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter can be brought close together Applying pressure and reducing temperature can liquefy gases. Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide (CO2)? It is stored  under high pressure. Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere* without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice. Thus, we can say that pressure and temperature determine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or gas. • Now, heat slowly and observe. • What do you infer from the above activity? A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation and the direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition. 1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have already learnt that the difference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles.

        "You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with– • an increase of surface area: We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation increases. For example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out. • an increase of temperature: With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state. • a decrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases. • an increase in wind speed: It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding. 1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE COOLING? In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation.

At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour.

        "• Matter is made up of small particles. • The matter around us exists in three states—solid, liquid and gas. • The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in solids, intermediate in liquids and minimum in gases. • The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic energy of the particles are minimum in the case of solids, intermediate in liquids and maximum in gases. What happens when you pour some acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm? The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool. After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface. Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation? Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer? During summer, we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. We know that during evaporation, the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour. The heat energy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good absorber of water helps in absorbing the sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for easy evaporation. Why do we see water droplets on the outer surface of a glass containing ice-cold water? Let us take some ice-cold water in a tumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on the outer surface of the tumbler. The water vapour present in air, on coming in contact with the cold glass of water, loses energy and gets converted to liquid state, which we see as water droplets."

  "full_text": "As we look at our surroundings, we see a large\nvariety of things with different shapes, sizes\nand textures. Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed “matter”. The air we breathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small drop of water or a\nparticle of sand — every thing is matter. We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surroundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\nTatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Greek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter.\nModern day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical nature.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\nmatter based on its physical properties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1 Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the nature of matter. One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, whereas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the nature\nof matter — is it continuous or particulate?\nActivity ______________ 1.1\n•\nTake a 100 m L beaker.\n•\nFill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water.\n•\nDissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass rod.\n•\nObserve any change in water level.\n•\nWhat do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n•\nWhere does it disappear?\n•\nDoes the level of water change?\nIn order to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles. What was there in the spoon, salt\nor sugar, has now spread throughout water.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.\n1.1.2 HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES\nOF MATTER?\nActivity ______________ 1.2\n•\nTake 2–3 crystals of potassium\npermanganate and dissolve them in\n100 m L of water.\nFig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles\nof salt get into the spaces between particles\nof water.\n*\nThe SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).\n**\nThe SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m3). The common unit of measuring volume is\nlitre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm3, 1L = 1000 m L, 1 m L = 1 cm3.\n\nMATTER\nATTER\nATTER\nATTER\nATTER IN\nIN\nIN\nIN\nIN O\n O\n O\n O\n OUR\nUR\nUR\nUR\nUR S\n S\n S\n S\n SURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nChapter\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n•\nTake out approximately 10 m L of this\nsolution and put it into 90 m L of clear\nwater.\n•\nTake out 10 m L of this solution and\nput it into another 90 m L of clear water.\n•\nKeep diluting the solution like this 5 to\n8 times.\n•\nIs the water still coloured ?\n1.2.2 PARTICLES \nOF \nMATTER \nARE\nCONTINUOUSLY MOVING\nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \n1.3\n1.3\n1.3\n1.3\n1.3\n•\nPut an unlit incense stick in a corner\nof your class. How close do you have to\ngo near it so as to get its smell?\n•\nNow light the incense stick. What\nhappens? Do you get the smell sitting\nat a distance?\n•\nRecord your observations.\nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n•\nTake two glasses/beakers filled with\nwater.\n•\nPut a drop of blue or red ink slowly\nand carefully along the sides of the first\nbeaker and honey in the same way in\nthe second beaker.\n•\nLeave them undisturbed in your house\nor in a corner of the class.\n•\nRecord your observations.\n•\nWhat do you observe immediately after\nadding the ink drop?\n•\nWhat do you observe immediately after\nadding a drop of honey?\n•\nHow many hours or days does it take\nfor the colour of ink to spread evenly\nthroughout the water?\nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \nActivity \n 1.5\n 1.5\n 1.5\n 1.5\n 1.5\n•\nDrop a crystal of copper sulphate or\npotassium permanganate into a glass\nof hot water and another containing\ncold water. Do not stir the solution.\nAllow the crystals to settle at the\nbottom.\n•\nWhat do you observe just above the\nsolid crystal in the glass?\n•\nWhat happens as time passes?\n•\nWhat does this suggest about the\nparticles of solid and liquid?\n•\nDoes the rate of mixing change with\ntemperature? Why and how?\nFrom the above three activities (1.3, 1.4 and\n1.5), we can conclude the following:\nFig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of\nmatter. With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium permanganate can\ncolour a large volume of water (about\n1000 L). So we conclude that there must be\nmillions of tiny particles in just one crystal\nof potassium permanganate, which keep\non dividing themselves into smaller and\nsmaller particles.\nThe same activity can be done using 2 m L\nof Dettol instead of potassium permanganate.\nThe smell can be detected even on\nrepeated dilution.\nThe particles of matter are very small –\nthey are small beyond our imagination!!!!\n1.2 Characteristics of Particles of\nMatter\n1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE\nBETWEEN THEM\nIn activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles\nof sugar, salt, Dettol, or potassium\npermanganate got evenly distributed in water.\nSimilarly, when we make tea, coffee or\nlemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type\nof matter get into the spaces between particles\nof the other. This shows that there is enough\nspace between particles of matter.\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\n•\nIf we consider each student as a\nparticle of matter, then in which group\nthe particles held each other with the\nmaximum force?\nActivity ______________ 1.7\n•\nTake an iron nail, a piece of chalk and\na rubber band.\n•\nTry breaking them by hammering,\ncutting or stretching.\n•\nIn which of the above three\nsubstances do you think the particles\nare held together with greater force?\nActivity ______________ 1.8\n•\nTake some water in a container, try\ncutting the surface of water with your\nfingers.\n•\nWere you able to cut the surface of\nwater?\n•\nWhat could be the reason behind the\nsurface of water remaining together?\nThe above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8)\nsuggest that particles of matter have force\nacting between them. This force keeps the\nparticles together. The strength of this force of\nattraction varies from one kind of matter to\nanother.\nuestions\n1.\nWhich of the following are\nmatter?\nChair, air, love, smell, hate,\nalmonds, thought, cold, lemon\nwater, smell of perfume.\n2.\nGive reasons for the following\nobservation:\nThe smell of hot sizzling food\nreaches you several metres\naway, but to get the smell from\ncold food you have to go close.\n3.\nA diver is able to cut through\nwater in a swimming pool. Which\nproperty of matter does this\nobservation show?\n4.\nWhat are the characteristics of\nthe particles of matter?\nParticles of matter are continuously\nmoving, that is, they possess what we call\nthe kinetic energy. As the temperature rises,\nparticles move faster. So, we can say that with\nincrease in temperature the kinetic energy of\nthe particles also increases.\nIn the above three activities we observe\nthat particles of matter intermix on their own\nwith each other. They do so by getting into\nthe spaces between the particles. This\nintermixing of particles of two different types\nof matter on their own is called diffusion. We\nalso observe that on heating, diffusion\nbecomes faster. Why does this happen?\n1.2.3 PARTICLES OF MATTER ATTRACT\nEACH OTHER\nActivity ______________ 1.6\n•\nPlay this game in the field— make four\ngroups and form human chains as\nsuggested:\n•\nThe first group should hold each\nother from the back and lock arms\nlike Idu-Mishmi dancers (Fig. 1.3).\nFig. 1.3\n•\nThe second group should hold hands\nto form a human chain.\n•\nThe third group should form a chain\nby touching each other with only their\nfinger tips.\n•\nNow, the fourth group of students\nshould run around and try to break the\nthree human chains one by one into\nas many small groups as possible.\n•\nWhich group was the easiest to break?\nWhy?\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n1.3 States of Matter\nObserve different types of matter around you.\nWhat are its different states? We can see that\nmatter around us exists in three different\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter.\nNow, let us study about the properties of\nthese three states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\nActivity _____________ 1.9\n•\nCollect the following articles — a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n•\nSketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n•\nDo all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n•\nWhat happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dropped?\n•\nAre these capable of diffusing into each\nother?\n•\nTry compressing them by applying\nforce. Are you able to compress them?\nAll the above are examples of solids. We\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\nshape, so they are rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\na solid?\n(b) What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in different jars these take the\nshape of the jar. Are they solid?\n(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we are able to compress it. Why?\nAll the above are solids as:\n•\nA rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape when\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n•\nThe shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal remains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n•\nA sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we press it, the air\nis expelled out and we are able to\ncompress it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\nActivity _____________1.10\n•\nCollect the following:\n(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b) containers of different shapes. Put\na 50 m L mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder from\nthe laboratory.\n•\nWhat will happen if these liquids are\nspilt on the floor?\n•\nMeasure 50 m L of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into different containers one\nby one. Does the volume remain the\nsame?\n•\nDoes the shape of the liquid remain the\nsame ?\n•\nWhen you pour the liquid from one\ncontainer into another, does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they are\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\nsaw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\nliquids. The gases from the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living creatures need to breathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can breathe\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\noxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\nhigher than that of solids. This is due to the\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\nfreely and have greater space between each\nother as compared to particles in the solid\nstate.\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\na large number of balloons from a single\ncylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many\nballoons is he able to fill from one cylinder.\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder.\nActivity _____________1.11\n•\nTake three 100 m L syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n•\nRemove the pistons from all the\nsyringes.\n•\nLeaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the third.\n•\nInsert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. You may apply some vaseline\non the pistons before inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n•\nNow, try to compress the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.\nWe have observed that gases are highly\ncompressible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compressed gas. Compressed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compressed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering there,\nby the smell that reaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread from the kitchen, reach us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and large space\nbetween them, gases show the property of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container. The\npressure exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit area\non the walls of the container.\nFig. 1.4\n•\nWhat do you observe? In which case\nwas the piston easily pushed in?\n•\nWhat do you infer from your\nobservations?\nFig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic\npictures of the three states of matter. The\nmotion of the particles can be seen and\ncompared in the three states of matter.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n1.4.1 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE\nActivity _____________1.12\n•\nTake about 150 g of ice in a beaker and\nsuspend a laboratory thermometer so\nthat its bulb is in contact with the ice,\nas in Fig. 1.6.\nuestions\n1.\nThe mass per unit volume of a\nsubstance is called density.\n(density = mass/volume).\nArrange the following in order of\nincreasing density – air, exhaust\nfrom chimneys, honey, water,\nchalk, cotton and iron.\n2.\n(a)\nTabulate the differences in\nthe characterisitcs of states\nof matter.\n(b)\nComment upon the following:\nrigidity, compressibility,\nfluidity, filling a gas\ncontainer, shape, kinetic\nenergy and density.\n3.\nGive reasons\n(a)\nA gas fills completely the\nvessel in which it is kept.\n(b)\nA gas exerts pressure on the\nwalls of the container.\n(c)\nA wooden table should be\ncalled a solid.\n(d)\nWe can easily move our hand\nin air but to do the same\nthrough a solid block of wood\nwe need a karate expert.\n4.\nLiquids generally have lower\ndensity as compared to solids.\nBut you must have observed that\nice floats on water. Find out why.\n1.4 Can Matter Change its State?\nWe all know from our observation that water\ncan exist in three states of matter–\n•\nsolid, as ice,\n•\nliquid, as the familiar water, and\n•\ngas, as water vapour.\nWhat happens inside the matter during\nthis change of state? What happens to the\nparticles of matter during the change of\nstates? How does this change of state take\nplace? We need answers to these questions,\nisn’t it?\nQ\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water, (b) conversion\nof water to water vapour\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\n•\nStart heating the beaker on a low flame.\n•\nNote the temperature when the ice\nstarts melting.\n•\nNote the temperature when all the ice\nhas converted into water.\n•\nRecord your observations for this\nconversion of solid to liquid state.\n•\nNow, put a glass rod in the beaker and\nheat while stirring till the water starts\nboiling.\n•\nKeep a careful eye on the thermometer\nreading till most of the water has\nvaporised.\n•\nRecord your observations for the\nconversion of water in the liquid state\nto the gaseous state.\nOn increasing the temperature of solids,\nthe kinetic energy of the particles increases.\nDue to the increase in kinetic energy, the\nparticles start vibrating with greater speed.\nThe energy supplied by heat overcomes the\nforces of attraction between the particles. The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving more freely. A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point.\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles.\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go?\nYou must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\nThis happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperature, it is considered that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The word latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat energy\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\nSo, particles in water at 0o C (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature.\nWhen we supply heat energy to water,\nparticles start moving even faster. At a certain\ntemperature, a point is reached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break free\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough energy to change into the\nvapour state.\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\n(100o C = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\nCan you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\nat the same temperature. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra energy\nin the form of latent heat of vaporisation.\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.\nSo, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.\nWe have learnt that substances around\nus change state from solid to liquid and from\nliquid to gas on application of heat. But there\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nenclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come\ncloser? Do you think that increasing or\ndecreasing the pressure can change the state\nof matter?\nare some that change directly from solid state\nto gaseous state and vice versa without\nchanging into the liquid state.\nActivity _____________1.13\n•\nTake some camphor. Crush it and put\nit in a china dish.\n•\nPut an inverted funnel over the china\ndish.\n•\nPut a cotton plug on the stem of the\nfunnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\n* atmosphere (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas. The unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa):\n1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa. The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. The\natmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere, and is taken as the normal atmospheric pressure.\nFig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphor\nFig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter\ncan be brought close together\nApplying pressure and reducing\ntemperature can liquefy gases.\nHave you heard of solid carbon dioxide\n(CO2)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid\nCO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state\non decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere*\nwithout coming into liquid state. This is the\nreason that solid carbon dioxide is also known\nas dry ice.\nThus, we can say that pressure and\ntemperature determine the state of a\nsubstance, whether it will be solid, liquid\nor gas.\n•\nNow, heat slowly and observe.\n•\nWhat do you infer from the above\nactivity?\nA change of state directly from solid to gas\nwithout changing into liquid state is called\nsublimation and the direct change of gas to\nsolid without changing into liquid is called\ndeposition.\n1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE\nWe have already learnt that the difference in\nvarious states of matter is due to the\ndifference in the distances between the\nconstituent particles. What will happen when\nwe start putting pressure and compress a gas\nFig. 1.9: Interconversion of the three states of matter\nDeposition\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\n•\nRecord the room temperature.\n•\nRecord the time or days taken for the\nevaporation process in the above cases.\n•\nRepeat the above three steps of activity\non a rainy day and record your\nobservations.\n•\nWhat do you infer about the effect of\ntemperature, surface area and wind\nvelocity (speed) on evaporation?\nYou must have observed that the rate of\nevaporation increases with–\n•\nan increase of surface area:\nWe know that evaporation is a surface\nphenomenon. If the surface area is\nincreased, the rate of evaporation\nincreases. For example, while putting\nclothes for drying up we spread them\nout.\n•\nan increase of temperature:\nWith the increase of temperature, more\nnumber of particles get enough kinetic\nenergy to go into the vapour state.\n•\na decrease in humidity:\nHumidity is the amount of water vapour\npresent in air. The air around us cannot\nhold more than a definite amount of\nwater vapour at a given temperature. If\nthe amount of water in air is already\nhigh, the rate of evaporation decreases.\n•\nan increase in wind speed:\nIt is a common observation that clothes\ndry faster on a windy day. With the\nincrease in wind speed, the particles of\nwater vapour move away with the wind,\ndecreasing the amount of water vapour\nin the surrounding.\n1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE\nCOOLING?\nIn an open vessel, the liquid keeps on\nevaporating. The particles of liquid absorb\nenergy from the surrounding to regain the\nenergy lost during evaporation. This\nabsorption of energy from the surroundings\nmake the surroundings cold.\nuestions\n1.\nConvert \nthe \nfollowing\ntemperature to celsius scale:\na. 300 K\nb. 573 K\n2.\nWhat is the physical state of\nwater at:\na. 250o C\nb. 100o C ?\n3.\nFor any substance, why does the\ntemperature remain constant\nduring the change of state?\n4.\nSuggest a method to liquefy\natmospheric gases.\n1.5 Evaporation\nDo we always need to heat or change pressure\nfor changing the state of matter? Can you\nquote some examples from everyday life where\nchange of state from liquid to vapour takes\nplace without the liquid reaching the boiling\npoint? Water, when left uncovered, slowly\nchanges into vapour. Wet clothes dry up. What\nhappens to water in the above two examples?\nWe know that particles of matter are\nalways moving and are never at rest. At a given\ntemperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there\nare particles with different amounts of kinetic\nenergy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction\nof particles at the surface, having higher\nkinetic energy, is able to break away from the\nforces of attraction of other particles and gets\nconverted into vapour. This phenomenon of\nchange of liquid into vapours at any\ntemperature below its boiling point is called\nevaporation.\n1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION\nLet us understand this with an activity.\nActivity _____________1.14\n•\nTake 5 m L of water in a test tube and\nkeep it near a window or under a fan.\n•\nTake 5 m L of water in an open china\ndish and keep it near a window or\nunder a fan.\n•\nTake 5 m L of water in an open china\ndish and keep it inside a cupboard or\non a shelf in your class.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nMatter is made up of small particles.\n•\nThe matter around us exists in three states—solid, liquid\nand gas.\n•\nThe forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in\nsolids, intermediate in liquids and minimum in gases.\n•\nThe spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic\nenergy of the particles are minimum in the case of solids,\nintermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.\nWhat happens when you pour some\nacetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?\nThe particles gain energy from your palm or\nsurroundings and evaporate causing the palm\nto feel cool.\nAfter a hot sunny day, people sprinkle\nwater on the roof or open ground because\nthe large latent heat of vaporisation of water\nhelps to cool the hot surface.\nCan you cite some more examples from\ndaily life where we can feel the effect of cooling\ndue to evaporation?\nWhy should we wear cotton clothes in\nsummer?\nDuring summer, we perspire more\nbecause of the mechanism of our body which\nkeeps us cool. We know that during\nevaporation, the particles at the surface of\nthe liquid gain energy from the surroundings\nor body surface and change into vapour. The\nheat energy equal to the latent heat of\nvaporisation is absorbed from the body\nleaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good\nabsorber of water helps in absorbing the\nsweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for\neasy evaporation.\nWhy do we see water droplets on the outer\nsurface of a glass containing ice-cold\nwater?\nLet us take some ice-cold water in a\ntumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on\nthe outer surface of the tumbler. The water\nvapour present in air, on coming in contact\nwith the cold glass of water, loses energy and\ngets converted to liquid state, which we see\nas water droplets.\nuestions\n1.\nWhy does a desert cooler cool\nbetter on a hot dry day?\n2.\nHow does the water kept in an\nearthen pot (matka) become cool\nduring summer?\n3.\nWhy does our palm feel cold\nwhen we put some acetone or\npetrol or perfume on it?\n4.\nWhy are we able to sip hot tea or\nmilk faster from a saucer rather\nthan a cup?\n5.\nWhat type of clothes should we\nwear in summer?\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\n•\nThe arrangement of particles is most ordered in the case of\nsolids, in the case of liquids layers of particles can slip and\nslide over each other while for gases, there is no order,\nparticles just move about randomly.\n•\nThe states of matter are inter-convertible. The state of matter\ncan be changed by changing temperature or pressure.\n•\nSublimation is the change of solid state directly to gaseous\nstate without going through liquid state.\n•\nDeposition is the change of gaseous state directly to solid\nstate without going through liquid state.\n•\nBoiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk\n(whole) of the liquid change into vapour state.\n•\nEvaporation is a surface phenomenon. Particles from the\nsurface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction\npresent in the liquid and change into the vapour state.\n•\nThe rate of evaporation depends upon the surface area exposed\nto the atmosphere, the temperature, the humidity and the\nwind speed.\n•\nEvaporation causes cooling.\n•\nLatent heat of vaporisation is the heat energy required to change\n1 kg of a liquid to gas at atmospheric pressure at its\nboiling point.\n•\nLatent heat of fusion is the amount of heat energy required\nto change 1 kg of solid into liquid at its melting point.\n•\nSome measurable quantities and their units to remember:\nQuantity\nUnit\nSymbol\nTemperature\nkelvin\nK\nLength\nmetre\nm\nMass\nkilogram\nkg\nWeight\nnewton\nN\nVolume\ncubic metre\nm3\nDensity\nkilogram per cubic metre\nkg m–3\nPressure\npascal\nPa\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\n1.
