Law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. 3.1.2 LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS Lavoisier, along with other scientists, noted that many compounds were composed of two or more elements and each such compound had the same elements in the same proportions, irrespective of where the compound came from or who prepared it. In a compound such as water, the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus, if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass, whatever the method or the source from which it is obtained. This led to the law of constant proportions which is also known as the law of definite proportions. This law was stated by Proust as “In a chemical substance the elements are always present in definite proportions by mass”. The next problem faced by scientists was to give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the basic theory about the nature of matter. Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of matter, which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the Greeks and said that the smallest particles of matter are atoms. His theory was based on the laws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic theory provided an explanation for the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite proportions.",
        "John Dalton was born in a poor weaver’s family in 1766 in England. He began his career as a teacher at the age of twelve. Seven years later he became a school principal. In 1793, Dalton left for Manchester to teach  mathematics, physics and chemistry in a college. He spent most of his life there teaching and researching. In 1808, he presented his atomic theory which was a turning point in the study of matter. According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all matter, whether an element, a compound or a mixture is composed of small particles called atoms. The postulates of this theory may be stated as follows: (i) All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms, which participate in chemical reactions. (ii) Atoms are indivisible particles, which cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. (iii) Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and chemical properties. (iv) Atoms of different elements have different masses and chemical properties. (v) Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form compounds. (vi) The relative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound. You will study in the next chapter that all atoms are made up of still smaller particles."

        "Have you ever observed a mason building walls, from these walls a room and then a collection of rooms to form a building? What is the building block of the huge building? What about the building block of an ant-hill? It is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the building blocks of all matter are atoms. How big are atoms? Atoms are very small, they are smaller than anything that we can imagine or compare with. More than millions of atoms when stacked would make a layer barely as thick as this sheet of paper. Atomic radius is measured in nanometres. 1/10 9 m = 1 nm 1 m = 109 nm Relative Sizes Radii (in m) Example 10–10 Atom of hydrogen 10–9 Molecule of water 10–8 Molecule of haemoglobin 10–4 Grain of sand 10–3 Ant 10–1 Apple Fig. 3.2: An image of the surface of silicon 3.2.1 WHAT ARE THE MODERN DAY SYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS? Dalton was the first scientist to use the symbols for elements in a very specific sense. When he used a symbol for an element he also meant a definite quantity of that element, that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements be made from one or two letters of the name of the element. Fig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as proposed by Dalton Reprint 2025-26 ATOMS AND MOLECULES 29 In the beginning, the names of elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time. For example, the name copper was taken from Cyprus. Some names were taken from specific colours. For example, gold was taken from the English word meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) is an international scientific organisation which approves names of elements, symbols and units. Many of the symbols are the first one or two letters of the element’s name in English. The first letter of a symbol is always written as a capital letter (uppercase) and the second letter as a small letter (lowercase). For example",
        "(i) hydrogen, H (ii) aluminium, Al and not AL (iii) cobalt, Co and not CO. Symbols of some elements are formed from the first letter of the name and a letter, appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i) chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the names of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium, potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each element has a name and a unique chemical symbol. (The above table is given for you to refer to whenever you study about elements. Do not bother to memorise all in one go. With the passage of time and repeated usage you will automatically be able to reproduce the symbols). 3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS The most remarkable concept that Dalton’s atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic mass. According to him, each element had a characteristic atomic mass. The theory could explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the mass of an individual atom was a relatively difficult task, relative atomic masses were determined using the laws of chemical combinations and the compounds formed. Let us take the example of a compound, carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and oxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3 g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to form CO. In other words, carbon combines with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose we define the atomic mass unit (earlier abbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now written as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the mass of one carbon atom, then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and oxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However, it is more convenient to have these numbers as Table 3.1: Symbols for some elements Element Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbol",

While searching for various atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/ 16 of the mass of an atom of naturally occurring oxygen as the unit. This was considered relevant due to two reasons: • oxygen reacted with a large number of elements and formed compounds. • this atomic mass unit gave masses of most of the elements as whole numbers. However, in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope was chosen as the standard reference for measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth (1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12. The relative atomic masses of all elements have been found with respect to an atom of carbon-12. Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without any standard weight with him. He takes a watermelon and says, “this has a mass equal to 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit mass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4. Fig. 3.4 : (a) Watermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of watermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can weigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon Similarly, the relative atomic mass of the atom of an element is defined as the average mass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

        "Reprint 2025-26 ATOMS AND MOLECULES 31 3.3.1 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS The molecules of an element are constituted by the same type of atoms. Molecules of many elements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc. are made up of only one atom of that element. But this is not the case with most of the non- metals. For example, a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it is known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3 atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead of the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number of atoms constituting a molecule is known as its atomicity. Metals and some other elements, such as carbon, do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together. Let us look at the atomicity of some non-metals.

Compounds composed of metals and non- metals contain charged species. The charged species are known as ions. Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them. An ion can be negatively or positively charged. A negatively charged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the positively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for example, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its constituent particles are positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged 3.3.2 MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS Atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions to form molecules of compounds.

        "learn the symbols and combining capacity of the elements. The combining power (or capacity) of an element is known as its valency. Valency can be used to find out how the atoms of an element will combine with the atom(s) of another element to form a chemical compound. The valency of the atom of an element can be thought of as hands or arms of that atom. Human beings have two arms and an octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch hold of a few people in such a manner that all the eight arms of the octopus and both arms of all the humans are locked, how many humans do you think the octopus can hold? Represent the octopus with O and humans with H. Can you write a formula for this combination? Do you get OH4 as the formula? The subscript 4 indicates the number of humans held by the octopus. The valencies of some common ions are given in Table 3.6. We will learn more about valency in the next chapter. * Some elements show more than one valency. A Roman numeral shows their valency in a bracket.

        "The rules that you have to follow while writing a chemical formula are as follows: • the valencies or charges on the ion must balance. • when a compound consists of a metal and a non-metal, the name or symbol of the metal is written first. For example: calcium oxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron sulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO), etc., where oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are non- metals  and are written on the right, whereas calcium, sodium, iron and copper are metals, and are written on the left. • in compounds formed with polyatomic ions, the number of ions present in the compound is indicated by enclosing the formula of ion in a bracket and writing the number of ions outside the bracket. For example, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of polyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not required. For example, NaOH. 3.4.1 FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS The simplest compounds, which are made up of two different elements are called binary compounds. Valencies of some ions are given in Table 3.6.

Another Indian philosopher,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles normally exist\nin a combined form which gives us various\nforms of matter.\nAround the same era, ancient Greek\nphilosophers – Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter, a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further. Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists recognised the difference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame interested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.\nAntoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination.\n3.1 Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established after\nmuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L. Proust.\n3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS\nIs there a change in mass when a chemical\nchange (chemical reaction) takes place?\nActivity ______________ 3.1\n•\nTake one of the following sets, X and Y\nof chemicals—\nX\nY\n(i)\ncopper sulphate sodium carbonate\n(ii)\nbarium chloride\nsodium sulphate\n(iii)\nlead nitrate\nsodium chloride\n•\nPrepare separately a 5% solution of\nany one pair of substances listed\nunder X and Y each in 10 m L in water.\n•\nTake a little amount of solution of Y in\na conical flask and some solution of\nX in an ignition tube.\n•\nHang the ignition tube in the flask\ncarefully; see that the solutions do not\nget mixed.

Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.\nSimilarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained.\nThis led to the law of constant proportions\nwhich is also known as the law of definite\nproportions. This law was stated by Proust as\n“In a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass”.\nThe next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws.\nBritish chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the nature of matter.\nDalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter, which was till then just a philosophy.\nHe took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law of\nconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions.\nJohn Dalton was born in\na poor weaver’s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his career as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach \nmathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter.\nAccording to Dalton’s atomic theory, all\nmatter, whether an element, a compound or\na mixture is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)\nAll matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions.\n(ii)\nAtoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be created or destroyed in a\nchemical reaction.\n(iii)\nAtoms of a given element are identical\nin mass and chemical properties.\n(iv)\nAtoms of different elements have\ndifferent masses and chemical\nproperties.\n(v)\nAtoms combine in the ratio of small\nwhole numbers to form compounds.\n(vi)\nThe relative number and kinds of\natoms are constant in a given\ncompound.\nYou will study in the next chapter that all\natoms are made up of still smaller particles.\n uestions\n1.\nIn a reaction, 5.3 g of sodium\ncarbonate reacted with 6 g of\nacetic acid.

This is because our entire world is made\nup of atoms. We may not be able to see them,\nbut they are there, and constantly affecting\nwhatever we do.

What\nis the building block of the huge building?\nWhat about the building block of an ant-hill?\nIt is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the\nbuilding blocks of all matter are atoms.\nHow big are atoms?\nAtoms are very small, they are smaller than\nanything that we can imagine or compare\nwith. More than millions of atoms when\nstacked would make a layer barely as thick\nas this sheet of paper.\nAtomic radius is measured in nanometres.\n1/10 9 m\n=\n1 nm\n1 m\n=\n109 nm\nRelative Sizes\nRadii (in m)\nExample\n10–10\nAtom of hydrogen\n10–9\nMolecule of water\n10–8\nMolecule of haemoglobin\n10–4\nGrain of sand\n10–3\nAnt\n10–1\nApple\nFig. 3.2: An image of the surface of silicon\n3.2.1 WHAT ARE THE MODERN DAY\nSYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT\nELEMENTS?\nDalton was the first scientist to use the\nsymbols for elements in a very specific sense.\nWhen he used a symbol for an element he\nalso meant a definite quantity of that element,\nthat is, one atom of that element. Berzilius\nsuggested that the symbols of elements be\nmade from one or two letters of the name of\nthe element.\nFig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as proposed by\nDalton\nReprint 2025-26 ATOMS AND MOLECULES\n\nIn the beginning, the names of elements\nwere derived from the name of the place\nwhere they were found for the first time. For\nexample, the name copper was taken from\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\nfrom the English word meaning yellow.\nNow-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element’s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase).\nFor example\n(i)\nhydrogen, H\n(ii)\naluminium, Al and not AL\n(iii)\ncobalt, Co and not CO.\nSymbols of some elements are formed from\nthe first letter of the name and a letter,\nappearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.\nOther symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek.\nFor example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol.\n(The above table is given for you to refer to\nwhenever you study about elements. Do not\nbother to memorise all in one go. With the\npassage of time and repeated usage you will\nautomatically be able to reproduce\nthe symbols).\n3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS\nThe most remarkable concept that Dalton’s\natomic theory proposed was that of the atomic\nmass. According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed.\nLet us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose\nwe define the atomic mass unit (earlier\nabbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the\nlatest IUPAC recommendations, it is now\nwritten as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the\nmass of one carbon atom, then we would\nassign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and\noxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However, it\nis more convenient to have these numbers as\nTable 3.1: Symbols for some elements\nElement\nSymbol\nElement\nSymbol\nElement\nSymbol\nAluminium\nAl\nCopper\nCu\nNitrogen\nN\nArgon\nAr\nFluorine\nF\nOxygen\nO\nBarium\nBa\nGold\nAu\nPotassium\nK\nBoron\nB\nHydrogen\nH\nSilicon\nSi\nBromine\nBr\nIodine\nI\nSilver\nAg\nCalcium\nCa\nIron\nFe\nSodium\nNa\nCarbon\nC\nLead\nPb\nSulphur\nS\nChlorine\nCl\nMagnesium\nMg\nUranium\nU\nCobalt\nCo\nNeon\nNe\nZinc\nZn\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nwhole numbers or as near to a whole numbers\nas possible. While searching for various\natomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/\n16 of the mass of an atom of naturally\noccurring oxygen as the unit. This was\nconsidered relevant due to two reasons:\n•\noxygen reacted with a large number of\nelements and formed compounds.\n•\nthis atomic mass unit gave masses of\nmost of the elements as whole numbers.\nHowever, in 1961 for a universally\naccepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope\nwas chosen as the standard reference for\nmeasuring atomic masses. One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.\nThe relative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with respect to an atom of\ncarbon-12.\nImagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him. He takes a\nwatermelon and says, “this has a mass equal\nto 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit\nmass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of\nthe watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit\nhe is selling, relative to the mass of one piece\nof the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by\nrelative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.\nFig. 3.4 : (a) Watermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of\nwatermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can\nweigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon\nSimilarly, the relative atomic mass of the\natom of an element is defined as the average\nmass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the\nmass of one carbon-12 atom.\nTable 3.2: Atomic masses of\na few elements\nElement\nAtomic Mass (u)\nHydrogen\n\nCarbon\n\nNitrogen\n\nOxygen\n\nSodium\n\nMagnesium\n\nSulphur\n\nChlorine\n35.5\nCalcium\n\n3.2.3 HOW DO ATOMS EXIST?\nAtoms of most elements are not able to exist\nindependently.

A molecule can be defined\nas the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound that is capable of an independent\nexistence and shows all the properties of that\nsubstance. Atoms of the same element or of\ndifferent elements can join together to form\nmolecules.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26 ATOMS AND MOLECULES\n\n3.3.1 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS\nThe molecules of an element are constituted\nby the same type of atoms. Molecules of many\nelements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc.\nare made up of only one atom of that element.\nBut this is not the case with most of the non-\nmetals. For example, a molecule of oxygen\nconsists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it\nis known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3\natoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead\nof the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number\nof atoms constituting a molecule is known as\nits atomicity.\nMetals and some other elements, such as\ncarbon, do not have a simple structure but\nconsist of a very large and indefinite number\nof atoms bonded together.\nLet us look at the atomicity of some\nnon-metals.\nTable 3.3 : Atomicity of some\nelements\nType of\nName\nAtomicity\nElement\nNon-Metal\nArgon\nMonoatomic\nHelium\nMonoatomic\nOxygen\nDiatomic\nHydrogen\nDiatomic\nNitrogen\nDiatomic\nChlorine\nDiatomic\nPhosphorus\nTetra-atomic\nSulphur\nPoly-atomic\nTable 3.4 : Molecules of some\ncompounds\nCompound\nCombining\nRatio\nElements\n by\nMass\nWater (H2O)\nHydrogen, Oxygen\n1:8\nAmmonia (NH3) Nitrogen, Hydrogen 14:3\nCarbon\ndioxide (CO2)\nCarbon, Oxygen\n3:8\nActivity ______________ 3.2\n•\nRefer to Table 3.4 for ratio by mass of\natoms present in molecules and Table\n3.2 for atomic masses of elements. Find\nthe ratio by number of the atoms of\nelements in the molecules of\ncompounds given in Table 3.4.\n•\nThe ratio by number of atoms for a\nwater molecule can be found as follows:\nElement Ratio Atomic\nMass\nSimplest\nby\nmass\nratio/\nratio\nmass\n(u)\natomic\nmass\nH\n\n\n\n1 =1\n\nO\n\n\n\n16 =\n\n\n\n•\nThus, the ratio by number of atoms for\nwater is H:O = 2:1.\n3.3.3 WHAT IS AN ION?\nCompounds composed of metals and non-\nmetals contain charged species. The charged\nspecies are known as ions. Ions may consist\nof a single charged atom or a group of atoms\nthat have a net charge on them. An ion can be\nnegatively or positively charged. A negatively\ncharged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the\npositively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for\nexample, sodium chloride (Na Cl). Its\nconstituent particles are positively charged\nsodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged\n3.3.2 MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS\nAtoms of different elements join together\nin definite proportions to form molecules\nof compounds. Few examples are given in\nTable 3.4.\nReprint 2025-26 SCIENCE\n\nchloride ions (Cl–). A group of atoms carrying\na charge is known as a polyatomic ion (Table\n3.6). We shall learn more about the formation\nof ions in Chapter 4.\nlearn the symbols and combining capacity of\nthe elements.\nThe combining power (or capacity) of an\nelement is known as its valency. Valency can\nbe used to find out how the atoms of an\nelement will combine with the atom(s) of\nanother element to form a chemical compound.\nThe valency of the atom of an element can be\nthought of as hands or arms of that atom.\nHuman beings have two arms and an\noctopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch\nhold of a few people in such a manner that all\nthe eight arms of the octopus and both arms\nof all the humans are locked, how many\nhumans do you think the octopus can hold?\nRepresent the octopus with O and humans\nwith H. Can you write a formula for this\ncombination? Do you get OH4 as the formula?\nThe subscript 4 indicates the number of\nhumans held by the octopus.\nThe valencies of some common ions are\ngiven in Table 3.6. We will learn more about\nvalency in the next chapter.\n* Some elements show more than one valency. A Roman numeral shows their valency in a bracket.\nTable 3.5: Some ionic compounds\nIonic\nConstituting\nRatio\nCompound\nElements\nby\nMass\nCalcium oxide\nCalcium and\noxygen\n5:2\nMagnesium\nMagnesium\nsulphide\nand sulphur\n3:4\nSodium\nSodium\nchloride\nand chlorine\n23:35.5\n3.4 Writing Chemical Formulae\nThe chemical formula of a compound is a\nsymbolic representation of its composition.

Then their charges are\ncriss-crossed to get the formula.\n4.\nFormula of magnesium chloride\nFormula : Mg Cl2\nThus, in magnesium chloride, there are\ntwo chloride ions (Cl-) for each magnesium\nion (Mg2+).

For\nexample, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of\npolyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not\nrequired. For example, Na OH.\n3.4.1 FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS\nThe simplest compounds, which are made up\nof two different elements are called binary\ncompounds. Valencies of some ions are given\nin Table 3.6. You can use these to write\nformulae for compounds.\nWhile writing the chemical formulae for\ncompounds, we write the constituent elements\nand their valencies as shown below.

This concept can be extended to\ncalculate molecular masses. The molecular\nmass of a substance is the sum of the atomic\nmasses of all the atoms in a molecule of the\nsubstance. It is therefore the relative mass of\na molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u).\nExample 3.1 \nExample 3.1 \nExample 3.1 \nExample 3.1 \nExample 3.1 (a) Calculate the relative\nmolecular mass of water (H2O).\n(b) Calculate the molecular mass of\nHNO3.\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\nSolution:\n(a) Atomic mass of hydrogen = 1u,\noxygen = 16 u\nSo the molecular mass of water, which\ncontains two atoms of hydrogen and one\natom of oxygen is\n= 2 ´ 1+ 1´16\n= 18 u\n(b) The molecular mass of HNO3 = the\natomic mass of H + the atomic mass of\nN+ 3 ´ the atomic mass of O\n= 1 + 14 + 48 = 63 u\n3.5.1 FORMULA UNIT MASS\nThe formula unit mass of a substance is a sum\nof the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula\nunit of a compound.

This is known as the Law\nof Definite Proportions.\n•\nAn atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot\nusually exist independently and retain all its chemical\nproperties.\n•\nA molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound capable of independent existence under ordinary\nconditions.
