      "text": "As we look at our surroundings, we see a large\nvariety of things with different shapes, sizes\nand textures. Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed “matter”. The air we breathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small drop of water or a\nparticle of sand — every thing is matter. We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surroundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\nTatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Greek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter.\nModern day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical nature.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\nmatter based on its physical properties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1 Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the nature of matter. One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, whereas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the nature\nof matter — is it continuous or particulate?\nActivity ______________ 1.1\n•\nTake a 100 m L beaker.\n•\nFill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water.\n•\nDissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass rod.\n•\nObserve any change in water level.\n•\nWhat do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n•\nWhere does it disappear?\n•\nDoes the level of water change?\nIn order to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles. What was there in the spoon, salt\nor sugar, has now spread throughout water.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.\n1.1.",

This shows that there is enough\nspace between particles of matter.\nReprint 2025-26 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n\n•\nIf we consider each student as a\nparticle of matter, then in which group\nthe particles held each other with the\nmaximum force?\nActivity ______________ 1.7\n•\nTake an iron nail, a piece of chalk and\na rubber band.\n•\nTry breaking them by hammering,\ncutting or stretching.\n•\nIn which of the above three\nsubstances do you think the particles\nare held together with greater force?\nActivity ______________ 1.8\n•\nTake some water in a container, try\ncutting the surface of water with your\nfingers.\n•\nWere you able to cut the surface of\nwater?\n•\nWhat could be the reason behind the\nsurface of water remaining together?\nThe above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8)\nsuggest that particles of matter have force\nacting between them.
