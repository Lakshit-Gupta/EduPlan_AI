      "text": "In Chapter 3, we have learnt that atoms and\nmolecules are the fundamental building\nblocks of matter. The existence of different\nkinds of matter is due to different atoms\nconstituting them. Now the questions arise:\n(i) What makes the atom of one element\ndifferent from the atom of another element?\nand (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as\nproposed by Dalton, or are there smaller\nconstituents inside the atom? We shall find\nout the answers to these questions in this\nchapter. We will learn about sub-atomic\nparticles and the various models that have\nbeen proposed to explain how these particles\nare arranged within the atom.\nA major challenge before the scientists at\nthe end of the 19th century was to reveal the\nstructure of the atom as well as to explain its\nimportant properties. The elucidation of the\nstructure of atoms is based on a series of\nexperiments.\nOne of the first indications that atoms are\nnot indivisible, comes from studying static\nelectricity and the condition under which\nelectricity is conducted by different\nsubstances.\n4.1 Charged Particles in Matter\nFor understanding the nature of charged\nparticles in matter, let us carry out the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 4.1\nA.\nComb dry hair. Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper?\nB.\nRub a glass rod with a silk cloth and\nbring the rod near an inflated balloon.\nObserve what happens.\nFrom these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together, they\nbecome electrically charged? Where does this\ncharge come from? This question can be\nanswered by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of charged particles.\nMany scientists contributed in revealing\nthe presence of charged particles in an atom.\nIt was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle – the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron.",

It\nwas observed that the atoms of elements,\ncompletely filled with 8 electrons in the\noutermost shell show little chemical activity.\nIn other words, their combining capacity or\nvalency is zero. Of these inert elements, the\nReprint 2025-26 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n\nTable 4.1: Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements\nwith Electron Distribution in Various Shells\nhelium atom has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and all other elements have atoms with\neight electrons in the outermost shell.\nThe combining capacity of the atoms of\nelements, that is, their tendency to react and\nform molecules with atoms of the same or\ndifferent elements, was thus explained as an\nattempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.\nAn outermost-shell, which had eight electrons\nwas said to possess an octet. Atoms would\nthus react, so as to achieve an octet in the\noutermost shell. This was done by sharing,\ngaining or losing electrons. The number of\nelectrons gained, lost or shared so as to make\nthe octet of electrons in the outermost shell,\ngives us directly the combining capacity of the\nelement, that is, the valency discussed in the\nprevious chapter. For example, hydrogen/\nlithium/sodium atoms contain one electron\neach in their outermost shell, therefore each\none of them can lose one electron. So, they are\nsaid to have valency of one. Can you tell, what\nis valency of magnesium and aluminium? It\nis two and three, respectively, because\nmagnesium has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and aluminium has three electrons in\nits outermost shell.\nIf the number of electrons in the\noutermost shell of an atom is close to its full\ncapacity, then valency is determined in a\ndifferent way. For example, the fluorine atom\nhas 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its\nvalency could be 7.",

Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding.",
