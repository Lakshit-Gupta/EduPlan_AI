As the temperature rises,\nparticles move faster. So, we can say that with\nincrease in temperature the kinetic energy of\nthe particles also increases.\n\nIn the above three activities we observe\nthat particles of matter intermix on their own\nwith each other. They do so by getting into\nthe spaces between the particles. This\nintermixing of particles of two different types\nof matter on their own is called diffusion.
