      "text": "SCIENCE\n\nWe have learnt about the motion of objects and\nforce as the cause of motion. We have learnt\nthat a force is needed to change the speed or\nthe direction of motion of an object. We always\nobserve that an object dropped from a height\nfalls towards the earth. We know that all the\nplanets go around the Sun. The moon goes\naround the earth. In all these cases, there must\nbe some force acting on the objects, the planets\nand on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp\nthat the same force is responsible for all these.\nThis force is called the gravitational force.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\ngravitation and the universal law of\ngravitation. We shall discuss the motion of\nobjects under the influence of gravitational\nforce on the earth. We shall study how the\nweight of a body varies from place to place.\nWe shall also discuss the conditions for\nobjects to float in liquids.\n9.1 Gravitation\nWe know that the moon goes around the earth.\nAn object when thrown upwards, reaches a\ncertain height and then falls downwards. It is\nsaid that when Newton was sitting under a tree,\nan apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made\nNewton start thinking. He thought that: if the\nearth can attract an apple, can it not attract\nthe moon? Is the force the same in both cases?\nHe conjectured that the same type of force is\nresponsible in both the cases. He argued that\nat each point of its orbit, the moon falls\ntowards the earth, instead of going off in a\nstraight line. So, it must be attracted by the\nearth. But we do not really see the moon falling\ntowards the earth.\nLet us try to understand the motion of the\nmoon by recalling activity 7.11.\nActivity ______________ 9.1\n•\nTake a piece of thread.\n•\nTie a small stone at one end. Hold the\nother end of the thread and whirl it\nround, as shown in Fig. 9.1.\n•\nNote the motion of the stone.\n•\nRelease the thread.\n•\nAgain, note the direction of motion of\nthe stone.\nFig. 9.1:\nA stone describing a circular path with a\nvelocity of constant magnitude.\nBefore the thread is released, the stone\nmoves in a circular path with a certain speed\nand changes direction at every point.",

Why an army tank weighing\nmore than a thousand tonne rests upon a\ncontinuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus\nhas much wider tyres? Why cutting tools have\nsharp edges? In order to address these\nquestions and understand the phenomena\ninvolved, it helps to introduce the concepts\nof the net force in a particular direction (thrust)\nand the force per unit area (pressure) acting\non the object concerned.\nLet us try to understand the meanings of\nthrust and pressure by considering the\nfollowing situations:\nSituation 1: You wish to fix a poster on a\nbulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this\ntask you will have to press drawing pins with\nyour thumb. You apply a force on the surface\narea of the head of the pin. This force is directed\nperpendicular to the surface area of the board.\nThis force acts on a smaller area at the tip of\nthe pin.\nQ\nFig. 9.3:\nTo fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed\nwith the thumb perpendicular to the board.\nSituation 2: You stand on loose sand. Your\nfeet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on\nthe sand. You will find that your body will not\ngo that deep in the sand. In both cases the\nforce exerted on the sand is the weight of your\nbody.\nReprint 2025-26 GRAVITATION\n\nYou have learnt that weight is the force\nacting vertically downwards. Here the force is\nacting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.\nThe force acting on an object perpendicular to\nthe surface is called thrust.\nWhen you stand on loose sand, the force,\nthat is, the weight of your body is acting on\nan area equal to area of your feet.",

Observe\nwhether both of them reach the\nground simultaneously.\n•\nWe see that paper reaches the ground\nlittle later than the stone. This happens\nbecause of air resistance. The air offers\nresistance due to friction to the motion\nof the falling objects. The resistance\noffered by air to the paper is more than\nthe resistance offered to the stone. If\nwe do the experiment in a glass jar\nfrom which air has been sucked out,\nthe paper and the stone would fall at\nthe same rate.\nchange in the velocity of falling objects? While\nfalling, there is no change in the direction of\nmotion of the objects. But due to the earth’s\nattraction, there will be a change in the\nmagnitude of the velocity. Any change in\nvelocity involves acceleration. Whenever an\nobject falls towards the earth, an acceleration\nis involved. This acceleration is due to the\nearth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this\nacceleration is called the acceleration due to\nthe gravitational force of the earth (or\nacceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by\ng. The unit of g is the same as that of\nacceleration, that is, m s–2.\nWe know from the second law of motion\nthat force is the product of mass and\nacceleration.

The force is along the line\njoining the centres of two objects.\nIn the absence of this force, the stone flies off\nalong a straight line. This straight line will be\na tangent to the circular path.\nMore to know\nTangent to a circle\nA straight line that meets the circle at\none and only one point is called a\ntangent to the circle. Straight line\nABC is a tangent to the circle at\npoint B.\nThe motion of the moon around the earth\nis due to the centripetal force. The centripetal\nforce is provided by the force of attraction of\nthe earth. If there were no such force, the\nmoon would pursue a uniform straight line\nmotion.\nIt is seen that a falling apple is attracted\ntowards the earth. Does the apple attract the\nearth? If so, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards an apple. Why?\nAccording to the third law of motion, the\napple does attract the earth. But according\nto the second law of motion, for a given force,\nacceleration is inversely proportional to the\nmass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an\napple is negligibly small compared to that of\nthe earth. So, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards the apple. Extend the same argument\nfor why the earth does not move towards the\nmoon.\nIn our solar system, all the planets go\naround the Sun.",
